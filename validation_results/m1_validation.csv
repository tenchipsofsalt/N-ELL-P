"""oh my god generic_name,"" i did not have enough time to finish my power point, me too generic_name said. i think our school should add two hours more and we should come four-day school weeks like some businesses they work for ten hours and they only work four days it can benefits students and teachers because, some students can have more time to do their homework, some teachers and students can saved more gas and money, and some students can ask their teacher for more help. first,students and teachers saved more gas and money. for example, my friend needs to drive herself to school everyday and she needs to pay for her gas. the other day she told me that coming to school for five days is stressful because, she has to pay for gas and she is not working everyday like she just too, so her parents have to pay the gas for her .they told her if she do not start to pay for her own gas they where going to take the car away from her, i told her about how some businesses have adopted just going four- days to work for ten hours and i told her that our school should have four-day school week too, i think that would be a good idea and she thinks that is a great idea too, because she gets to saved money and gas and she do not have to worry about paying a lot of money for gas anymore and her parents would not be mad at her anymore because she would have the money to pay for gas. other example can be my spanish teacher she lives a little far from school and she has to drive to school, but she is having some problems and she does not have enough money to pay for her gas. she told me that if she do not get the money to pay her gas she was going to be absent for some day into she get the money to buy gas for her car, that make me so sad because she is my favorite teacher, she is like a mom to me, and she would not be able to come to school just because she dont have enough money to pay her gas. my friend told her about what i said and she things its a great statement because she would have more time to grade students homework ad would have more time to spent with her family. second, students can have more time to do their homework. for example, myself sometimes in my math or chemistry class we talk about something new and it takes almost the hold class and my teachers give us a lot of homework so i think the if we go school for ten hours it would be great because i would have a lot of time to do all my homework or i would have time to study too and i would just get home to relax and i would not get stress because i",4.0,4.0,4.0,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.036900281906128,2.875152826309204,2.90293288230896,3.0106592178344727,2.8210740089416504,2.9243173599243164
"do you think students should work on assignments from school at home? in this prompt i will argue about how students can study from long distance, not all schools approve the current subject. if students were to study from home it would be difficult for them to understand what the assignment that is being asked to complete at certain time. the students should be able to afford a device which is necessary to study any subject. attending classes from home can cause for students to be able to work more and do their assignments on time. schools will not exist if students leave to study home which will make it hard for them to communicate with teachers when help is needed. students would not meet each other or talk physically which would be awkward, can cause them to not trust each other if it comes to a project that needs to be done. physical education would not be a class since everything would be on devices which is a conflict, which is needed to graduate. in many short word students will be gaining so much weight that they ll not be able to do certain sports they want or walk to their destination. typing online or video conferencing is not easy if the person on camera is shy and doesn t like video conferencing which can be very often. accessing to both subjects can not be trusted if the school will be monitoring every movement you take on your device. testing online can be easy to cheat if the teacher is not around walking and watching what your doing. students might not know many things but cheating and being sneaky are the two most known words we understand very well. in other words there are advantages to studying online, disadvantages online and it would be a big disappointment for students to fail almost every class that needs to be taken for graduation. if they have a job they will consider work their first priority instead of school. student s would not receive a scholar ship or diploma so that they can go to college and accomplishing the goal of having a better job. some people say that school is very important for students, that they ll earn more money than their parents who probably dont have a well paid job and education. but i think it can benefit sometimes it can be a amazing idea for students to study home because they won t drop out of school. students have different emotions that trigger them to want to leave school behind, since they start working more to pay bills that need to be paid each month. all students should go to school to focus on what they want to be in life or do. physical experience is not the same as typing online or video conference. knowing that student s can succeed in different ways is not bad even so they will be expected to have any sort of education someday in the future. school is providing knowledge for those who pay",3.5,3.5,4.5,4.0,4.0,3.5,3.8678183555603027,3.991030216217041,4.072562217712402,4.113789081573486,4.0363450050354,3.9362952709198

"it has been said that first imperssions are almost impossible to change, do you agree or disagree? in my past experience, i would highly disagree with this statement. when first meeting somebody, you don t always get the right thoughts about that specific person. once knowing somebody personally your thoughts start changing, your mind starts messing up on thinking ""what should i think about this person?"". due to my past experience i always have luck to my first opinion changing to a good opinion after getting to know them. i always ask my friends what were there thoughts of me when they met me for the very first time and all of my friends would always tell me that i look like i was mean and not very kind. after, they re opinions later changed once they got to me personally, knowing my personality and knowing how kind i am. my friends were very suprised. second, i would insists of not always having a first opinion on when seeing somebody for the first time because that usually is never how the person actually is. first imperssions always depend on the person on how there feeling or just based of anything that can be said. second impressions always get more better once they seen each other at least ones. third, i would like to speak on my past experiences with this statement on why i disagree with this reasoning. when i was a couple years younger i had some very means thing said about me in middle school due to a couple of very mean people. due to those sayings and rumors a various amount of people knew about me and the stuff that was said about me. people thought they already know me through thick and thin but in reality they really didn t. once, i wanted to meet new people they never actually really wanted to speak to me or actually meet me because they already had there first impression because of the sayings. later on, years started passing by and a few people started meeting me more and started speaking to me and once they did they noticed that i was very different person then what people would say about me. in conclusion, in my past experience i would highly think in my beliefs i would defiendely not based my first impression on somebody i m just meeting. i like to get treated on how i treat others. first impressions are never good that s why it s never good to get based off that. you ve read my about my past and now know why i don t go off that. if you ever decided to go off first imperssions and not change your mind about your first impression then good luck to you.",4.0,4.0,3.5,4.0,4.5,4.0,3.684846878051758,3.6685798168182373,3.6894772052764893,3.730417490005493,3.702796220779419,3.7272989749908447
"i am strongly agree the failures in our lifes means to keep going and be a successful person. although some say success not consists of going from failure because people always fell many times keeping doing the same mistakes in several times in their lifes, actually success consists of going from failure because failure help us to learn more in our lifes and get experiences to teach other people. those who believe success not consists of going from failure have they reasons. one reason people always fell many times keeping doing the same mistakes in several times in their lifes. but doing the same mistakes many times does not help people to be successful; makes the person wake in front of others. people that are better to them can make bullying at them because they feel that they are perfect than others .many of the people that keep thinking that they are a loser think about diying is the better thing to get out of the failures. did you know is that % f the teenagers kill them self instated of find help to keep going with their lifes. it is very scary and make me sad at the same time. if we use social medias we can see people talking about their lifes or using drugs and drugs makes the person to lose more their mind. however, success consists of going from failure because failure help us to learn more in our lifes. learning from failure to failure is better for all the people. having the enthusiasm in our mind can be the better word to start our life every day. we are capable of doing many things it does not matter how many times we have to do the same things to be better in our feature but we have to keep going not matter what. in my position i have a experience; when i was in my country i did not what to do with my life; i just was trying to finish my middle school, get a job and then have a family and now here i am making better things for my life; now i am tinking about to have a better life. when i came to usa i was tinking about how am i going to do if i do not nothing about the language but now i feel more conformist knowing the language because makes me keep going studying. i though that learning another language was a new obstacle for me to keep going we my life. also, success consists of going from failure because people get experiences to teach people. there are many people that think that they are failure and they are not; i think that every people are genius. the things is that people don not let the talents get out and that can be because they think about others people opinions about them. i have many experiences keep seeing people about failure. had you ever try to help others? i have it done many times. when i was in my country",3.0,3.5,3.0,3.5,2.5,3.0,3.219618320465088,2.9837687015533447,2.9992218017578125,3.23050594329834,3.055206537246704,3.014805555343628

"many people believe that they do not need advises from others in order to take decisions in their life,and they believe they should take their own decisions. i do not agree with them. it is important to listen what other people think about it. each person is different in a special own way and someone else might help you to solve your problem. i believe people should seek guidance from experts and authorities because they may have a better idea,or they may have been in the same situation before. one of the main reasons is that other people may have been there before and they may know what to do. for example, you are undecided about taking swimming classes or piano classes,and you know you are a great swimmer,but you ve also wanted to play piano since you were years old. your brother have been in that situation before, and he thinks that you should take piano classes from monday to wednesday after school, and swimming classes every friday after school, but you have to work from thursday to sunday;then he says that you should take piano classes every monday and wednesday after school ,and swimming classes every tuesday after school .you believe that is what best suits for you. another reason is that other people might have a better or different idea than yours. another example is that your parents give you two choices: going to canada for spring break or going to the bahamas for christmas break. generic_name,your best friend have already visited those places and she tells you to go to canada because she knows you love extreme low temperatures .you tell your parents that you ve decided to go to canada and once you are there you realize that it was the best decision you ve taken. thanks to your friend s advise;you are enjoying your trip,and you are glad that you asked for her opinion. on the other hand,letting others influence on the decisions you take is not always the best thing to do. a simple example can be that you go to the mall and decide to buy a pair of shoes but you do not know what color to choose, so you ask your sister and she thinks that the red pair is the best for you; you buy it and when you get home, you realize that you do not like those shoes. the first thing you would probably do is blame on her because she told you to buy the red pair, but if you take that decision by yourself and you regret for the decision you make; you cannot blame on somebody else except for you. in conclusion, people who seek guidance from their family,experts, or authorities are most likely to take the right decision. all persons sometimes may need an advise from someone on what to do, or if they should follow their own instincts; but the one who will make the decision is you, so do not blame on others for the decisions you make. humans are not perfect and",3.5,3.5,4.0,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.8784663677215576,4.112211227416992,4.013261318206787,4.085126876831055,4.008952617645264,4.100113868713379

"have you ever wondered what it is like to have a homework club at your school, well its pretty useful. the idea is for kids to do their homework at school instead of at home, you can get help from a teacher and also work with your buddies. one reason why i argue for school clubs to be available is because you it gives you time to do other stuff such as, spending time with your family,spending time with your friends,and even go to the movies. if you do your homework at the homework club you won t have to worry about due dates, quizzes, or tests. if you dont go the homework club you will always have tons of homework and not even do it which can cause your grades to fall down and probably not graduate if the required skills aren t meet. secondly, if you and your friend are in the same class and get the same homework then you can work on it together,check each others papers, and quiz each other on it. if you work on it alone you might get confused and frustrated, or maybe stressed, obviously copying one another does not make you learn anything, but there is a teacher who can help both of you at the same time. video games are very fun and addictive but you cant play if you got homework in the way. if you get you homework done then you have the whole day to play with your friends, communicate with them and even battle to the lat one standing. some video games have blood, gore, and violence and some kids love those games which can be a small problem but not a big one, most parents can take devices and electronics away because kids dont do their homework so if you want to play video games and have fun you better go to homework club. in conclusion the homework club should be available and going so that kids can finish their homework all at once and have fun in and out of school. homework is really important and kids very often dont do their homework and thats probably the reason why kids hate school and do not want to got to school.",4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.5,3.690488576889038,3.477571964263916,3.5523104667663574,3.6873648166656494,3.6157970428466797,3.61816668510437
i agree with that because positive attitude always bring the success in our life. it helps us with alots of things in our life. all people love those who have positive mentality and a good personality. in order to be successful in life u need to be respectful with every single things that we do everyday. we can get so much benifit out of it. it helps people to get more friends and make a good community. it also make our family think that we are smart and make them feel proud of us. the first thing we all should do is to love our self if we cannot do that it will be hard for us to control our positive attitude. if we don t love our self we can t love others as well as you do to ourself. we are human we cannot be same as others in some point we make mistakes in life we always should try to move forward. some of us might have have seen some people they can t be satisfy with their life beacause of their behavior and the way how they think of there life. we need to conduct our self in a perticular way to bring the power of success. there are many people who can t show their love to people or who are kind of broke on their life most of them have negative mentality. its not their fault maybe the situation makes them to be like that some of us living with depression and it causes a massive differents into our brain our thinking area and more other part or side effects. it also happened to me when i was freshmen during the highschool year. i started to giving up on my life i didn t feel like to doing anything in life. every single day was the hell of my life. i broke down myself and put my self somewhere where no one can find me. i didn t talk to anybody just trying to stay at home all the times and realised how could i get out of this kind of situation. i was starting to loose friends in that time. only those will understand if they ever gone through depression. that was the worst feelings i ever felt in my life. i was trying so hard to figure out why this is happening to me and where does this come from and didn t get any response out of this. i felt negative every time. i tried so hard to change the situation but it didn t work. i didn t have anyone to share my feelings all i did is just to kept that in my heart and made my self cry alot. i throught of myself i will never be successful in life. after few days passed one of my friend came to my house just to visit our family member and me. when i see him i was little happy to see him after a long time. i took him into my,3.5,3.0,4.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.4075677394866943,3.14994215965271,3.0927796363830566,3.2996790409088135,3.0124144554138184,3.0778355598449707
"what are the benefits of working with a group and working alone? i believe that working in groups helps you to have more ideas, more knowledge, because if you communicate with your group members, they ll think about different ideas to proceed the work that is getting done. working alone sometimes helps you more than working with groups because you are responsible for your own work. i rather work by myself because i ve had bad experience working with groups. when i work in groups sometimes i m the one that has to do all the work, and in my opinion if we are working in groups we have to help each other, communicate and share our thoughts because if we don t do that what s the point of working in groups. however, i think working in groups is important because you can come out of your comfort zone and be free to share your thoughts with your group members, and you can make friends too. for example, i m a very shy person, it s rare the times i talk in class but when i m in a group i have to talk, share my thoughts with my group members and communicate with them. reasons why i prefer working alone are: i focus more doing my own work, it s only my responsibility not others, i have to worry to turn it in on time, if i get a bad grade it s going to be my fault not others, i m responsible for my own actions, i have to make sure if everything is right to get all the credit. reasons why i don t like to work in groups are: sometimes they re not responsible for doing their part, if they do their work they do it all messy( you can t even understand their hand writing), they play around too much because sometimes they take it as free time, they spend most of the time on their phone instead of doing what they are supposed to do, sometimes they don t do their part in time and we have to turn it in late and don t get all the credit. i believe working in groups is beneficial but at the same time it s not, i think it depends with the people you work with, because if you work with people that do their work and actually care about school they will definitely be beneficial and make your group work out. if you work with someone who doesn t care and is always playing around, you won t get anything done and will receive a bad grade unless you do all the work and the other person will just get credit by not doing anything, in that case there is no point to work in groups. in conclusion, i believe it s more beneficial to work alone than groups because you can focus more on what you re doing and take responsibility of your own work, because if you don t take care of your school",4.0,3.5,4.5,4.0,3.5,4.0,3.8437912464141846,3.8584578037261963,3.85748291015625,4.0954718589782715,3.9218556880950928,3.8842790126800537

"should students be required to take a class in the arts and should those classes even be a elective? i believe students should have a choose in what they take while in school. most students when they are not interested in something will most likely not do good in that subject. if you put students in those classes when they dont want to take then the pass rate may drop in those classes. the music, drama, and art class should stay as electives for students that enjoy those classes. i do see how those classes can help a students with some aspects on life but if they dont want to be in that elective then they wont be as involved as everyone else. school is meant for learning and not just putting students in a class they dont like, it s not a good way to teach students. if the student have a choose in what they take, then will students find it interesting and will want to learn more. the classes students choose to take should help them get ready for there future career. i am opposed to having classes in the arts as a required class but i do believe they should stay as electives. since i am still a student myself, i know what it is like to be put in a class that i do not finding interesting. i do not feel as if the school should have the right to choose our required electives. student should have a choose in what class they want because it appeals to them and it s something they actually want to take. if a student choose that class they then choose it for a reason. thats why if a student gets something they dont like, they are no going to be as engaged in that class and not learn that much as well. a student should have a right not to take the classes in the arts and schools should not make it a required class neither. if school makes those classes required then the pass rate is going to drop and students will not want to attend school as much because they are failing a class they don t even like. the schools should keep those classes as electives and not as core classes. there are plenty of students that enjoy taking those classes and that do really good in them as well. the classes in the arts are great classes to have a option to take while in school, it opens so many doors for students that want to make a career out of those classes. i m sure some students learn a lot of life lessons while taking those classes and has helped them in some way. i believe you can learn a lot of skills in those classes as long as your engaged in them and actually like the classes. school should keep music, drama, and art class as electives so the people that want to take it can. the classes students take should help them in",4.0,3.5,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.851716995239258,4.121771335601807,4.190476417541504,4.123669624328613,4.0065531730651855,3.9918699264526367

"every students desperately waits for the weekends. because they hate all the school days. but believe me, adding one and a half hours to schools will be beneficial to all the students for their future. the school board should add one and a half hours to school each day because the students can learn more, they can use their time wisely, they can improve the understanding skills of the students. the school board should add one and a half hours to school day because all the students can learn more. a long time period can make all the students to get a good knowledge about their chapter or topic, so, most of the students might started to get good grades on their tests. the students can take their time to do their own work. so, all of them can discuss about their projects. sometimes the students can finish their homeworks during the class periods. that might save the time for everyone. firstly, the students can get some more knowledge is a reason why the school boards should add one and a half hours to school each day. another reason is, all the students can use their time wisely in the class. the students will be more into their study at that time rather than their phones. so, the time will be more useful to them. the students can finish their all work in the class. so, they can get some extra time to spend with their family and relatives. sometimes, the students can get some extra time to read books. and that can improve their reading skills. secondly, using the time properly is another reason why the school board should add one and a half hours to school each day. although, some people may argue that, adding one and a half hours to school each day is stressful to all the studens. but, believe me or not, all the teenage students are always on their phones. so, it isn t a bad idea to add one and a half hours to school each day. at least, they can t be in the touch of their electronic devices for one and a half hours! lastly, for a better understanding skills the school board should add one and a half hour to school each day. the teachers can explain the chapter or the topic by taking their time. so, the students will understand the chapter more better. the students will be more responsible and the teachers will teach the students with a good understanding level. that will be more beneficial for the whole class. good learning or understanding skills is the last reason why the school board should add one and a half hours to school each day. adding one and a half hour to school is beneficial to all the students for their future. because they can learn more about their topic, their time will be used more wisely for them, they will understand the subject better. the students will finish their work in time. they can read books, they can discuss about",3.5,3.0,3.5,4.0,3.5,3.5,3.872199535369873,4.13548469543457,4.017168045043945,4.086777687072754,4.055293083190918,4.085136890411377

"a wise man always said "" thinking out of the box can get you a better choice."" seeking multiple opinions can help people make a better choice for several reasons. first, they will have more choices to choose due to this problem. everybody will have a different idea because of their way to look at the problem, they might think the problem out of the box and give out some choice that you never think of. recently, my friend generic_name were in a problem of what sport should he choose and we all gave out different opinions because some of us think that which sport can benefit our future better, some of us think that is important to match your hobbies and benefit to your body health after you play the sport, but we never think about the sport that generic_name like better. it is important to think the problem in a different way because after that you can find a better way to solve it . second, seeking for multiple opinions can help you collect ideas and solve the problem with friends and family. it is important to think together with friends and family because it can help you with more ideas and power. recently, my friend generic_name got bully in school two moths ago, generic_name cry in the restroom alone because the person that bully him told that generic_name cannot tell anybody about what happen, after he get home he told his parents and principal start to find out the person bully generic_name. after that, generic_name know it is very important to let parents know that his feeling. third, seeking for multiple opinions can let people feel like they are not alone to this problem, most of the time people can cause the mind to do wrong things because they feel like no one want to help them and leave them alone. recently, generic_school did a report that said three percent of people died in the year is because they feel alone, they think that no one with help them. if everyone can also help each other when they have a problem, maybe we can make the world much better. in conclusion, seeking multiple opinions can make people make a better choice and it can also benefit other and make the world much better .",3.5,3.0,3.5,3.0,2.0,3.0,3.1738760471343994,2.95181941986084,2.986996650695801,3.126149892807007,2.941592216491699,2.998959541320801
"imagine of having your own business by the time you graduate from high school. i think its a good idea for students to commit or take specific courses at a young age for their future lifestyle because you will have more experiences also you can save a lot of money, you don t have to worry about for college. althogh some people think its a bad idea for students to commit to a career because they just into high school, however they will have more experience by the time they graduate frome high school and live a better lifestyle because they already havea good career and have money and they might have graduate early and started their own family or family business. some students like to be me a business man or women so the plan to take classes about thoses to topics so they can learn more and they can help the others with their busines. the first reason why its a good idea to commit to career in a young age is because you will gain more experience and gather information that can help you with your career and have a better lifestyle so you can have everything you need and don t need nobody to help and you can ask others for their advices on hows to gain more experience and some students can take online class. i understand having to plan your career little early in hard because you have to have good grades and enough credits graduate early. so if you want to have better lifestyle you have to put in te hard work and you can t stop unitl you reached your goal and your happy with it. also you apply for jobs to gain as many experience you wanna gain for explam you can work at the fast food resturants and at subway and the doctor offices or at walmart and forever twentyone. and having a business is hard because my dad has one and we barly get to see him because he s so busy and his bussines is not even to close to us is at tn and we get to see him only once a month or two. the second why having a career is so impartant because you can save alot of money like a lot. because saving money is good because you can really rich and you have to be selfish in the begging if you want to became something great in life. although you have to spend a lot oof money at first because you having for your classes and programs that your in so you can study what you want and there are some school that will help their students to be succesful in life but have to put in the hard work first if you don t then thats a big problem because your not going to be rich your not going have a lot of money to have good lifestyle. so thats why students need to applying for jobs at age of sixteen and build baby",3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.5,3.0305397510528564,2.785522937774658,2.7924416065216064,2.956397533416748,2.722383737564087,2.7453930377960205
"do we accomplish more by constantly doing something? thomas jefferson wrote, ""determine never to be idle... it is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing."" he believed that more would be accomplished if there was something being done most of the time, i agree with this. accomplishing a task motivates some people to do more, accomplishing more, it also helps us learn more about ourselves. although, people believe that being in-active is better because it provides less stress and more free time, it also keeps us from succeeding our daily tasks and influences us to be lazy. being busy would require us to be awake and alert of what we are doing. in some cases, after finishing up a task, all people want to do is move on and rest. in other cases, people choose to knock out more work that they have in mind. having this kind of mindset it good, because it allows a person to have more energy and to keep themselves busy. a personal experience would be when i was so tired one afternoon, but i had to keep myself from napping because i had homework due. after i completed that one homework, i was too awake to even sleep; so i decided to knock out other work i had in the meantime. in the end i received a better grade from that class and i had chores finished from that week so i didn t have to do anything in the weekend. to conclude this paragraph, when i accomplished one thing i ended up accomplishing more than i expected. we all have our different ways of living and learning. one way to help you learn more about yourself is by keeping busy. you learn how to manage your own time, you learn about how you react to a hectic environment which can help for future references, and you learn how your own mind works. for example, when i was in my sister s sixteenth birthday party, i also had school to focus on, homework to get done, and sol s to focus on. for me it was a pretty hectic schedule, but i learned how to respond and manage my time. learning how to manage my time came in handy when my sixteenth birthday came along. everyone has a different way of living and learning, and keeping myself busy taught me a lot about how i live and learn. although being in active provides us with less stress and more free time, which is not always a bad thing, it influences us to not only be more lazy, but to procrastinate. to procrastinate put off something that should be done, to leave it for that moment and do it later, as you repeatedly tell yourself, but you occasionally never end up doing it. procrastination can lead you to become more and more unprepared. being unprepared isn t the best way to live. having more free time can have it s positive outcomes, but also its negatives. for example, who wants to accomplish nothing",3.5,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.867553234100342,4.207712650299072,4.300018310546875,4.094485759735107,4.318846702575684,4.250280857086182

"the famous albert einstein always said ""imagination is more important than knowledge"". i agree with this amazing quote because without imagination you wouldn t be yourself. as a kid everyone has always imagined of them being like or better then someone. these are my reasons of why i agree with the famous albert einstein. first of all, without an imagination you wouldn t have dreams to succeed. myself for example i ve always wanted to be a professional soccer player. but than i realized that soccer isn t very popular in america. so than i started playing football and i enjoy playing that sport very much. since than i ve always imagine of being a professional football player. secondly, imagination is an everyday thing you use it everyday in many ways. imagination is like an opinion,no one can take that from you. it can be positive nor negative either way no one can change the way you think. imagination is everything because you always imagine or wish you were doing something or wish you were with someone. as a person that has dreams to succeed you need imagination to achieve them. as one can see,me as a football player. i use my imagination a lot for many reasons. because i am very competitive when it comes to sports, i always want to be better than the old me. i always want to be one step ahead from everyone. for that reason i think i use my imagination a lot. like if i ever lose at something i would think about it and say ""imagine if i won"". lastly, the famous quote can say a lot in my opinion. because without an imagination you wouldn t be a regular person.",4.0,3.0,4.0,3.5,4.0,3.5,3.7360095977783203,3.7039408683776855,3.8399431705474854,3.9189836978912354,3.8458046913146973,3.808820962905884
"think about the benefits of working with a group or working alone. which do i feel is more beneficial? well working alone get you more focus and not playing around. if working with a group it will be different then working alone, because you can work faster or get the answer of them and be a great group to past the class and work on it but working together as a group it will be hard not you not gonna focus too because they gonna be playing around and not pay attention to what the teacher is saying in class. some people wanna work alone or work as group and the reason why people want to do that because working long they can focus and not play around, and working as a group people are gonna work together just to play around and not be paying any attention just being in the phone or talking. teachers need to do something about working together as a group because they just gonna goof around and not do there work they just gonna be talking and being on their phone. i feel like people need to work alone so they can focus on there work and be paying attention to the teachers and do there work. i don t think people should work as a group. at the same time people should work as a group because they can help each other and give answer to each other",2.5,2.5,3.0,2.5,3.0,2.5,3.071977376937866,2.82846736907959,2.8414149284362793,3.0008091926574707,2.828240156173706,2.9350850582122803
"what would you think about an after school homework club at your school. do you think that it would help the students with their homework or that its just a waste of time to do this type of clubs. some people might think that the homework club its helpful and others don t. others might do it just to get their homework done early. that way they have free time at home to play games or to go out with friends. i think that this club can help so many students who have difficulty with certain subjects like math, english, or science. it can also help them get their homework done or any projects that they didn t finish in class. the teachers there can help the students with their work. also they can work with a friend that is in the club with them. it would be a really fun thing because you get everything done faster. some people might think that its a waste of time because they can do their homework at home. other students just go to get all their homework done early. they can also go to have a little fun with their friends after they are done with all their work that they had. this club can also help you study for a test that you re about to take or something else. they can also just go to play video games if they have no homework to do. i think that the schools should keep doing this club after school because it can help students get their homework done. that way the students can improve their grades that they have in the class. the students should also not be misbehaving while in the club. they shouldn t do any inappropriate things or say anything inappropriate during the afterschool club. if they do they should get a consequence. i would like to have afterschool homework club because it can help a lot of students with their work. they can get their homework done faster and get more help. you can also go and get your homework done earlier. you can study for a test that you re about to take. you can finish any projects that you didn t get to complete in class. afterschool homework club is a really cool thing that every school should have.",3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4.0,4.0,3.745199680328369,3.7495031356811523,3.815214157104492,3.9519288539886475,3.579819917678833,3.825857162475586
"some school districts offer programs that allow high students to gradute in three years instead of the traditional four years. in my opinion, i feel like it is a good idea for some school districts to allow high school students to graduate in three years instead of the traditional four years. the reason on why i feel like it is a good idea for students to graduate early is for job oppurtunity, entering college early and also moving other places and starting a whole new life without no worries on education no more. job oppurtunity s will help you out to save money, working on what you like doing and also find some jobs can help you get into college if you are interested. for example, i am studying about autotechnology and it is my second year doing it. my plans are to continue working on cars and hopefully find a job at a dealership so i can learn enough at college. another reason on why i feel like allowing students to graduate in three years instead of four is so that they can start off there future earlier than others by attending college. entering college early is a good thing because you have some time to pick and decide on what you might want to study and learn about so you can get your masters on it or so that you can finish early and move onto what s next on your accomplishments in life. my school has the option to do dual enrollment which basically means starting college already and getting already college credits and still having to be in high school. finally, another reason on why i feel like graduating high school earlier than others is to have the chance to move to another country or state and start a brand new. starting a brand new life can become very hard and very stressful. starting a new life moving somewhere else means finding a better job oppurtunity, finding a olace to live in your budjet and also finding new people to hang around with but in my opinion at the end it will all be worth it. some students are already looking somewhere to move on there own or with a roomate because they might be having problems at home that they don t want to deal with. at the same time of moving to another place you have to make sure that you are ready on what s about to come into your life. for example, paying bills, paying rent, house supplies and also if you have a vehicle make sure that your payments are on time. in conclusion, i feel like allowing high school students to graute in three years instead of the traditional four years is a good idea. job oppurtunity, entering college early and also moving to another state or country in my opinion are one of the main important things to focus on after finishing high school.",4.0,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.4070255756378174,3.3345935344696045,3.3644723892211914,3.3752095699310303,3.2699997425079346,3.456580638885498
"i agree with being honest at all times because you need to be honest with your true friends, you need to be honest with your family, and you to be honest with yourself. the first reason you need to be honest is with your true friends because your true friends are going to want you to tell the truth to them. your friends always check on you to see if you are okay and tell you how is your life so far .you got to tell the truth to them because they really care about you a lot. for example, what happens if you are in a bad situation like being chased by a stranger and you told your friend to call because you are being chased. the police got there in time to arrest the stranger who was chasing you. you see, friends care about you and for your safety as well. your friends will always got your back no matter what happens to you or them. your friends just want to hangout with you have fun . the second reason you need to be honest is with your family . you got to be honest with your family because you got to tell them the truth of what is going on in your life. what happens if your mom or dad are calling you while you are walking to school with your ringer cut off. they just checking on you and for your safety. your does not want you tell them lies cause sometimes kids do not want to tell their parents what is going on in school. you never know when they are getting bullied and being harassed. the lesson of the story is that always be honest and tell the truth with your family. the third reason you need to be honest is with yourself at all times. you have to trust yourself because you never know what is going to happen to you. for example, someone is selling drugs in school and he told you that you want some drugs . you have to think is this going to kill me or just say no. in my opinion i would say no to person who is selling the drugs. this actually can happen in real life . if you were in that position just say no or make an excuse . the lesson of the story is always be honest to yourself.",3.5,3.5,3.5,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.727745294570923,3.748603582382202,3.7881009578704834,3.8200652599334717,3.7123494148254395,3.7601194381713867

"we have to work to survive. employers give us the opportunity to work and to overcome different financial problems. many high schools have partnerships with companies that help student to know about different jobs and companies. some companies have internships and shadowing opportunities that helps student to find out their interest. schools should have partnership with compamies because it helps students to get ideas about work environment, work skills, and jods requirement the partnerships with companies and schools allow student to know waht kind of skills need for different jobs. then students can find out their strong points and select the jobs according to their skills. studens are good on math work on computer programing,web designing, and computer engineering. students without internships activities take time to select the work that they want to grow up. they suffer to select their jobs. on the other hand, students with internships activities already had began to grow their occupation. they are heading toward in college as well as their jobs. work environment is very importent. different people like different work environment. we should select the job that attends our demands. some people like to work individually while other like to work with group. internships and shadowing allow student to know about different work environments before select the jobs. some people may say people adjust themselves with the work environment but the question is how long time it will take a person to adjust with the environment?. also, in a recent report says that we accomplish more when we work in a favorable environment. all jobs have some requirments. all the jobs do not have same requirements. some jobs need experience while other jobs do not need experience. internships and shadowing opportunities help students to get these information from the employers. with these information student get a chance to prepair themselve. they meet the requirement before their high school graduation. people may say that job requirements can be find out in online, but often we get the wrong information from online. by internships and shadowing we are getting right information directly from the employer without any difficulty. in conclusion, students are getting a lot of information from the companies that have partnerships with the schools. it is a great way for the students to build up their future. this opportunities gave students ideas about jobs they should select. the informations help students to be successfull in their career life.",4.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.690530300140381,3.3486568927764893,3.4658753871917725,3.5338430404663086,3.301851987838745,3.5054433345794678

"american jazz legend duke ellington said, a problem is a change for you to do your best. i agree with that stamens because when you have a problem it a chance for you to to your best and overcome it. unfortunately that not the case. mostly in sports you are driven to do your best when losing. but adults tend not to do there best when facing a problem. you should be always motivated to do your best. if you play any sports you know that when you are losing you are motivated to do your best. no mater how many points you are losing by you try your best to make that come back and win the game. if you don t win that game you at least know that you tried your best. if you were to give up you would have wondered, if you tried would i have won. this not the only example, for example you boss is about to fire you and try you best to keep that job. there are many more examples you can try to be your best. some times adults have to face problem and they don t know what to do or how to face that problem, they think there nothing they can do. they give up form the start they don t try there best when facing that problem. they simply give up. they miss out on that chance. for example, my dad got fired from his job, he was depressed and did not care at all about anything. he did not try his best. he simply gave up. but you should never give up always give it your best no matter what. form trying your best you don t lose any thing you only gain something. you can t follow you dreams without trying you best, does not matter what you want to be. you will face problems no matter what path you take. for example bill gates he did not become one of the most successful people by doing nothing. he gave it his best. so why should you not give it your best . no matter who you are, you should take the words of duke ellington and try you best when facing a problem. does not matter if you are playing sports or having a issue at work. or trying to achieve you dreams . never fail to give it your best, or you will regret it.",2.5,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.5,3.0,3.225562572479248,3.116844892501831,3.0546727180480957,3.1712846755981445,3.1395459175109863,3.1691274642944336

"committing to a job at a young age is bad and good idea, why you may ask? well at a young age you might have a fantacy and a very huge immagination well at least i did, as a kid this could help because if you commit to a career at young age. when you re older you ll be an expert and know the job by memory. having to commit to a career at a young age can save you time in the future, when you have graduated you would automatically have a option and know what job you are going to do. this can also be a terrible idea because at that a young age you don t really know what you want as a career, you just go with what ever your parents or the person you look up to does and as you get older you relize you were not really into that career. your brain also isn t fully developed until you re older it is a proven fact. having a fantacy and a very great immagination is good because it can motivate you to choose a good carreer which you would obviosly enjoy in the future. may aslo be a bad idea because when you get older you learn to hate things you enjoyed as a kid and it would just leave you with a career you cant enjoy as much as you use too. for example when i was a kid i enjoyed to play football i always thought i would do it until i died. as i got older i began to hate it, because it wasn t really what i wanted to do it was what my dad wanted me to do which i enjoyed because it made him happy. now i know i want to travel the world and be a photographer and learned to speak up for myself and it helped me to communicate with my dad and be straight forward with him there for kids are confused at a young age. reasons why commiting to a career at a young age is a good idea. the more you get older the more you know about the job so you ll be a wealthy man getting paid good by the time you are twenty five. there for you wouldn t be worried and freaking out about what career you are going to do after school you would already be prepared mentally and physically. as a kid you enjoy whatever your parents are doing, so you would obviously choose a career to be with your parents and thats a good thing as a kid. it ll make the job easier, funnier and more comftorable.

"most students enjoy having a long summer vacation, but others prefer it not to be so long. schools usually do three months for a summer break, but people argue that there should only be a month of summer break. also have a longer winter break and a week off in the spring and fall. i do not think this is a good idea. even though, when it is time to come back to school students will have forgotten everything, it is nice to have a long summer break because people go on vacation a lot, students can have an opportunity to work full time, and reduces stress for students. educators should have a long summer break because people go on vacation a lot to see long distance relatives, or to just spend some quality time with family and have fun. for example, if you live in virginia it will be a long car ride to make it to florida or any other place. you will need a long break to plan your trip and have enough time to stay at any place you will go. other people do not necesarily go on trips to just see family maybe it is a gift or a tradition that families have. having time is the most important thing when it comes to going on a vacation. another reason why it is a necesity for students to have a long summer break is because most students will get to work full time and make more money of their own. most parents like their child to learn how real life is and what struggles you have to got through to get the things you want. being a teenager will make you want more things it is the age you will start to drive and experience new things. for example, you will get to the age of driving and you will ask your parents for a car. you will need to earn some money to help your parents out they might give you an estimate amount of how much they can give you, but if that is not enough for you then you need to find a job to get to where you want to be at. if you have a part time job you will eventually get to where you want to be, but it will take longer that is why having a full time job will be easier to get there. to have a full time job it means summer break needs to be longer. finally, my last reason why summer should be long for students is because it reduces stress for students. being in school all year is hard for most students because sometimes is not just school what you have to deal with it can be things going on at home. having to deal with both is difficult, so it is nice to have a long summer break to get a break from things. for example, if you keep failing tests it might be because you can not manage to study at home. after",5.0,4.5,4.0,4.0,4.5,4.5,3.8716795444488525,3.8763558864593506,3.8496227264404297,4.072109222412109,3.7049400806427,3.7488763332366943
dear principal i don t agree with your decisions about the new school policy. i think that students needs exercise. i believe that students joining sports is a good thing for there health and it also makes them happy. its not good for students to think about school work too much because it causes stress. if you change your mind maybe more students would actually work hard in school because of there accomplishment s in school. kids should be aloud to play any sport without doing anything. if they think about school work and sports at the same time it might cause them to stress out. at the same time i also want them to have fun in school. there are lots of reasons why students shouldn t have to work hard just to play the sport they want. changing school policy is a bad idea. i think it will encourage kids to work harder in school. not only it will encourage them they will also have a better future. changing the school policy back to normal would be a good thing for kids. they will also have a good exercise everyday because it encourage the to practice. i am also a sports fan my myself. i know how it feels if that happens to me. i wouldn t like it if i have to worry about my school work and my favorite sport. i hope that you will change your mind after reading this note. sincerely: student_name,3.0,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.608376979827881,3.539781332015991,3.537621259689331,3.5681800842285156,3.4362850189208984,3.550557851791382
"school districts shouldn t give the three year instead of four year program. why? because students should receive all the education they need to succeed everything they want with completing four years of high school. most colleges look for students that have completed four years of their high school education, also they don t like when students have free periods unless they have a specific reason of requesting free courses. students will always have time to do what are they want in life with a four year high diploma it doesn t matter if your birthday is late and you want to graduate with three years because you don t wanna graduate at that specific age. teachers, parents,siblings, they should be the ones telling they re children or young adult that it is important to complete there four years of high school. the process you have to follow to do a three year of high school is more stressful because you have to summer school or evening school where there are not really a lot of teachers to help out with most of the stuff you need help with. when your in school you have english, history, science, mathematics teachers, you have counselors librarians everyone that can help you with anything you need to finish high school. most students may graduate early because they have an illness, disease, or something and they just can t take the pressure of being in school no more. from my point of view parents should always talk to there children about how important education is for them they can pursue all there dreams if the parent didn t have the opportunity to finish there high school career. also entering college early wouldn t be so convenient because maybe the student missed something they didn t learn then when they get to college there like my teacher didn t teach me this or i don t know what that is. the work force accepts a lot of young teenage children that graduate from high school and expect them to have a high school diploma and of course they ll have a high school diploma but they wont know how many years they completed which i believe still shouldn t be accepted. children think that just because they have a high school diploma they re better then everyone else if you only completed three years you shouldn t feel superior to everyone else. i would feel disappointed in myself for not completing all the four years i needed because i would feel like i didn t complete everything i need to be the most intelligent most outgoing person i am. if your a child that believes you can t do it and finish high school because it s stressful, of course you can do it i punish myself all the time for saying that. i may not be the most smartest person in my family but i m giving it my all to complete my high school career as an older sister and role model of two younger",3.5,2.5,3.5,3.5,2.5,3.0,3.885115623474121,3.902127742767334,4.02264404296875,4.114583492279053,4.001455307006836,3.922339677810669
"have you had a friend sharing wisdom and experiences with you? you probably had that a million times. here is the thing though. people just want to learn the experience of you and the others, which isn t a bad thing. it s also important to learn each other s experiences. i think it is important to learn from other people s experiences because you get to understand who they are, you can help the person if they re in a situation, and you can communicate each other. to clarify this, let s dig in deeper. first, i think it s important that you understand who they are because you get to know about their favorite hobbies, the places they like to visit, the pets they have and their dream vacation. getting to know on who the person is can give you a good start off to make a bond, or form friendship between you and that person. if you shared your experiences with a person, they might feel interested on what you re talking about. telling a person on what you like can bring that person s attention deeper. second, it s important that you help the person if they re in a situation because you can cheer them up if they lost a family member. helping someone out can make that person feel better and most of all, feel comfortable, and they will think that you re a good person. if you didn t reach out and help somebody, they could start getting into a tougher situation where they might not be able to handle by themselves. they could also feel very lonely or left out, and that is not okay. third, communicating with others is important because you can text them in social media, such as instagram, snapchat, and facebook. you can also go shopping with them. communicating others bring closer friendship, and keep the bond strong between you and you re friend. watching movies and hanging out at each others house are another examples of communication. they re lots of ways to communicate with your friends and other people, and that is a good thing for friends. activities is another thing for communicating with other people because sometimes, when people do activities, it provides teamwork. in conclusion, i think it is important to learn from other people s experiences because you get to understand who they are, you can help the person if they re in a situation, and you can communicate each other. so now that you understand, think about these as you make new friends. question yourself on how to get a good start to form a bond between you and that person. try to reach out and help him/her if they need help with something. make that person feel comfortable by hanging out with them at lunch or at home. they might need good company from you!",4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.5,4.0,3.8801608085632324,4.2065749168396,4.133312702178955,4.1189703941345215,4.0718889236450195,4.197577476501465
"some people say that aim too high is not for them. this should be because people does not feel ready. some people would want to aim high, but they do not want to know how would be the outcome. although, some people think that aim too high is a waste of time, nevertheless, humans really need to set their aim too high to know if they would achieve their goals because some humans thinks that they are not prepare to aim too high and fail and some humans prefer to aim low and achieve their goals. my first reason is that some humans thinks that they are not prepare to aim too high and fail. for example, if a person aim too high but fail that person would not feel good about him. some times people who fail get depressed. if that is a humans who is a persistent person he would be trying more time. until that person achieve their big goal. also, that kind of people who are persistent that always keep trying that people one day they achieve all their goals. in addition, the key to have a awesome overcome is to never give up and never stop. my second reason is that some humans prefer to aim low and achieve their goals. people who do this are people that always want the easy thing. these people does not want to effort that much and achieve their goals. however, these people do not know the significant of have something that took a lot of efforts. in addition, some people may say that if they aim low they can achieve more things in the time a person that aim too high. thats not the point, the thing is that every human have to effort to know the significant of never give up. also, when humans has owned something by their own effort the valuate more what they had achieve. in summary, humans really need to set their aim too high to know if they would achieve their goals. some humans thinks that they are not prepare to aim too high and fail and some humans prefer to aim low and achieve their goals. also, on these latest years humans has been lazy than doesnt want to effort to do big things and achieve it. now humans really needs to efforts for something. every human need to aim high and be scared of failing that something normal, but never give up always keep going.",3.5,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.5,3.261167049407959,3.041588544845581,3.0537829399108887,3.2139689922332764,3.04549241065979,3.0477330684661865
"people should seek guidance for help, because like us are still having trouble in the real world even if we graduate from high school or college, we even still have trouble trying to make our live easy. having guidance is always helpful and learn something new. reason to have guidance is to release stress or don t add more stress. in daily hours people get stress out a lot at work and could get out of the control very easy,getting help from another one is good idea so you know what you doing and how you doing it. people stress things out and they don t know about what causing it, that give even more stress and have a chance to get an heart attack and lose motive to do work. guidance could help us by rethinking our plans or working. while taking a guidance you could learn more things that we didn t know of. having guidance will also help you keep tack in time and help everything more clean in your work space. it good idea to have an open mind and have work done easier and fast. having an open mind can give a good mind set in life and think more a head in time and saving time. another reason is people have depressing life or have health issuer. depressing is a big thing that come to life in everyone and it cause a lot problem the way they living. most of the population on earth have depressing in their life, so it a good idea to seek help at all time. people who having that need get some help from guidance right away to tell them what going on in their life, it could help them cure their depressing. it a bad idea to to let people guide they own way without any help at all, because trying teach yourself is hard enough, and try to teach yourself might get even more worst because they mind might be wrong and could cause more problem in later runs. people rather do it on their own and not get help because it might give them false inform that they need to learn or think it a waste of time, but guidance are here to help. having guidance will always help you and they always teach you more things. people can still guide on they own way, but it better to get guidance. it be more easier and get better in live in the long run. in conclusion, guidance are here to help release stress, learn better, get thought life, cure depressing, saving time, give more open mind it, have work done in time, and make life little bit more easy.",2.5,2.5,2.0,2.5,2.0,2.5,3.5190112590789795,3.1456961631774902,3.1840343475341797,3.4273245334625244,3.126467704772949,3.1667282581329346
"a football manager olegunnar solksajer once said ""prasing his players and kids helps them work to the best of their ability"". that is a very significant statement because every student have their own set of skills and abilities. some students are good in sports,math,science,art or music. however, plenty of students are not able to perform to the best of their ability because they have low self-confidence which is mainly caused by the lack of praise and incentive by their parents,teachers or coaches. praising a student s work is important because it helps build their confidence and motivates them to work harder. praising a student s work is vital for their productivity because it builds their confidence. studies show that people with high self-confidence are usually risk takers,creative,optimistic,hardworking and productive. this shows how important it is for teachers and parents to praise their students. self-confidence is not something that happens suddenly, it is a process that builds up from a young age. little praises and incentives from parents and teachers are not only important for the students performance in school but also when they transform into adults. additionally, another importance of praising students is the motivation for them to work harder. students always seem to work harder when they get an incentive or praise. that is because students feel appreciated for their work and it also make them feel like they are doing a good job so they always stay motivated to do better every time. motivation is vital for everyone because its as important as an oil is for a car. motivation is a motor that keeps the sudents happy and hopeful. motivated students always work hard and give their best effort. there are some people that think praising students will undrmine learning by lowering standards and some believe a true self-esteem and confidence comes from achievment and not from prasing. although it s a fair opinion, it is wrong because students who get praise from teachers and parents always seem to do better acadamically and in outside-school activities. in conclusion, praising a student s work is very important because it helps build their confidence and motivates them to work harder and smarter.",4.5,4.0,4.0,4.5,4.5,4.0,3.8821990489959717,4.189233779907227,4.257614612579346,4.07424783706665,4.173515319824219,4.269805431365967

i feel like best way is working with a group is great idea because you have the chances to meet new people you dont know and have little convestions with them while working on getting ideas and finding the right respone for your work on what the teacher gave as a group. well one good reason on why working with a group is a good idea my opionion is because by working in a group you can find different details on what the teacher given what to work on in a group yall can bring up all the information yall came with or got from the internt and have argument about which one should be the best answer. another reason on why is a good idea working with in a group it s a easy way to get a better garde as a group and working in a group is really fun you get to talk and use the computer sometimes the teachers let us use our phone and we make like a little group chat for us to talk about the work she told us to do and share our answers on the group chat and see who agree with it or who don t and we all got different reasons and at the end of the day we pick the support detail and use it. my benefits of working with a group is that if you are one of them students who really want to be in a group and help people and on there work show them how smart your are and that you in the group of people you are a hard worker.,3.0,2.5,3.0,3.0,3.5,3.0,3.1332335472106934,2.9874231815338135,3.0409421920776367,3.058439254760742,2.886176586151123,3.023200273513794

hey have you been asked to teach a group of elementary students a lesson? well you have been chosen to teach a group of students a lesson and the lesson was multiplying and dividing because it will teach how add and subtract quickly. the st example is like going to a grocery store and don t know how much does bags of chips cost for the party your going to well multiplying can help you figure out the cost. the nd example for dividing can help you figure out if you have a discount you can find the new cost and how much money you saved. final reason is like multiplying and dividing fractions like / times / that would equal / and dividing that by / will equal / because if you add that is would be / and subtracting that by / would be / which is . so in conclusion multiplying and dividing can help you get answer more fast than adding and subtracting over and over.,3.0,3.0,2.5,2.5,3.0,3.0,3.033174514770508,2.7854373455047607,2.7347850799560547,2.8791680335998535,2.8000500202178955,2.807061195373535
i disagree with schools having a program with older and youngest students many younger students does not know anything about program many older students are smartest then the youngest students many youngest students are not smarter than the older students . one day when i was on elementary school i was in th grade and my teacher put me on a program with older people and the older people were smarter than me and i din t knew anything and the older people knew everything i was the only one who dint knew any thing. . the other day i was on middle school and i was on a program and i was on th grade and i was in a program with youngest students the youngest students werent smartest than the older student and there was a kid who dint knew anything on the program. . the last thing when i was i high school i was in th grade and i went to a program with young students and i was smarter then younger students and and my teacher was prud of the older students.,2.5,2.0,2.5,2.0,2.0,2.5,2.9488275051116943,2.815584659576416,2.7961666584014893,2.9443814754486084,2.79852032661438,2.872267246246338
i disagree with the school board because we not trying be in school more time in school. also students need to have their own time outside of school with family and friends. i also think this because students spent hrs in school more than what they spend at home. my other idea is that i think the schools around that county should have a essay in all schools asking students about how they feel about this decision. the county should take the students decision as a answer about what they think because our ideas matter too. also the school should be thinking about the students benefits of being in school for longer and for less not just to one side. i think if they did that they point of view will change a lot knowing what students think also it would help them know about what students they are dealing with that would be a great advantage for them. that would help them with the decision and knowing what would be the impact on the students. this is my prompt to yall about if i agree or disagree.,2.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.5,2.5,3.5988576412200928,3.4040849208831787,3.3868303298950195,3.6100614070892334,3.458204507827759,3.4948856830596924

"do you think failure lead you to do better? in this paper i will argue about never losing enthusiasm by falling and falling. failure should be just another way to do better, because you try until you get it right, when you fail; failure lead you to success in life. also, enthusiasm and try is the key to success. first of all, when you try until you get it right, sometimes you get really frustrated. for example; in freshman year i remember that i couldn t actually get good grades in my algebra class, i remember that i try and try my harder to get good grades. i even stayed after school, i was doing my homework, i was watching videos from my teacher. however, i was still getting bad grades in my class but i keep trying and i finally become a success in the class. secondly, when you fail; failure lead you to success in life. when you are working on a project or you are working on a personal goal sometimes thing doesn t actually goes the way you had planted. for example; if you are trying to solve a mathematics problem but you never get the solution you re supposed to get. although, you keep trying and you always fail, you actually learning from it. however, by keep trying your best you actually getting experience from your failure and that helps you to success later in life. finally, enthusiasm and trying is the key to success. for example; when you want to achieve something but you fail, each time you re losing enthusiasm because you think that you can not do it, but if you keep trying and trying their will be a time that you will going to success and you would said that you try your best and never lost enthusiasm for your goal. in conclusion, some people said that failure doesn t lead you to success, but they wrong because the more you fail, the more you try, and when you get it right, it will be a completely success for you. going failure to failure led you to a good way to do better in life because the harder you try the better you do to success. in the future never stop trying without losing enthusiasm because enthusiasm is the key of your success.",3.0,3.5,4.0,4.0,3.5,3.5,3.7166683673858643,3.6518213748931885,3.5904579162597656,3.7719335556030273,3.591991662979126,3.597806692123413
"first impressions works as a normal form to react to a person, the impressions will depend how scary or funny it is, and how people feel in that moment. impressions are almost impossible to change, they come instantly, people can not have control of it because first impressions come naturally from the human, the maind sends the first impressions when people are impressed, and people are not prepared to the first impressions. it is impossible to change. first reason, impressions come naturally from people, they can not have control of it. for example, when people meet with other people, they automatically have impressions of the new people that they are meeting, do not matter what type of people they are, but the impressions naturally come. second example, people usually move around the country to live or visit, every new place that they are arriving, the impressions come by itself. third example, during the school year, the students are exploring more about the classes, they even have been not thinking about it, but they already have impressions what the classes talk about, and the students did not can change those first impressions about the classes. second reason, the maind has an important work on the first impressions, the mind sends the first impressions to you. for example, when people go to shopping to a marked, they are looking and comparing the prices from other marked. people are having impressions about the prices and their minds are working sending them impressions and also information from the other marked s prices. second example, people who work on hospital, they are constantly seeing people with cancer, their minds are prepared to make impressions and send them without any difficulty. the type of impression depends how their minds are prepared to react on that situation. third example, people who come to the u.s from other country normally they are having new impressions, their minds are having a big change. the mind is who make the biggest work to give the first impressions and adapt to the new type of live. third reason, people are not prepared to the first impressions that they have during they are discovering new things, it come by itself. for example, when people go to the cinema to see the new movie about the world, they do not have any idea about what is waiting for them, they just infer that the movie is about the world, but stating the movie they start to have impressions. the impressions come without notice them. second example,when people got years old, they are not prepared to do everything by himself, they start to have impressions on how hard if the life outside with more responsibilities and without their parents. impressions always surprise people because they never prepare for it. third example, people who are starting new job, they are learning how to do it. they are having impressions how the job is, they were not prepared for those impressions that they are having during they are learning the new job. in conclusion, first impressions are almost",4.0,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.5,4.0,3.639836072921753,3.5486795902252197,3.5416383743286133,3.562302350997925,3.4604427814483643,3.5155863761901855
"dear principal ,as a student i think we should balance the school menu of healththeir school lunches is a good idea and also a bad idea, the resaon why is when most students don t take care of their own body by eating junk food but most student like their favorite food for example, most students in my class when they eat their favorite food for example pizza, in lunch it will affect their stomach but not only their stomach but they have nothing health besides milk to eat. my second reason is when you eat health on school days your body will feel better and relax and also when you eat healthier foods your body can help you in the future as you grow older health foods in school would be a great way for students not to be sick and they need protein to grow. my thrid reason is if you take away our favorite food most students wont eat the healtheir food, remember when their was no fried chicken friday at lunch and thats like everyones favorite food the school was so upset they didnt eat lunch for the day over chicken. so in conclusion i think that we should balance them out like their should days were we eat health foods and days we can eat favortite foods. when the food is balance students will be able be more happy if they just have both their favorrite foods and something health to eat, so in my opinon i really hope you make students have both their favorrite foods and healtheir foods so that all students would be happy and so as their body.",2.5,2.0,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.5,3.0976569652557373,2.933854579925537,2.94659161567688,3.111445665359497,2.897263288497925,2.976530075073242

"""your character will be what you yourself choose to make it.""therefore,in my opinion character traits can be chose but it must show as true self that represent you. why, let me tell you; every on has their own unique traits even the traits they get from their parent. lastly animal spirit do show has traits that represent as our character traits. although,i do disagree with character traits with influences us that help improve our trait that can help us set right path. everyone has their own unique traits. some people has traits like kindness,honesty,caring,and more. unfourtely that some character traits can t be chose but sometime character traits chose you as your character traits .for example my character traits is pretty weird: kind honesty,helpful,caring,little crazy and lastly trickery like the fox. same with parents has their own unique character traits;however, parents character traits can be passed down to children base on their character traits and if they are worthy of the carry their parent s traits. for example,it remind me the time when i am all dressed up and got my hair done after that i look at the mirror; i notice that i look familiar at the time i realized that i look like mom. as poof that i do have my mom s gene meaning i have her physical look. as i explain even character trait and be passed down or chose have own character traits. next, everyone has their own spirit animal that is represent your character traits. for example if the person has the character trait which is playful,love water,caring,and fun loving as poof of this person character traits show their spirit animal is dolphin. therefore, anyone can chose their character trait that is best suit for them. it is unique for people and important having spirit animal and character traits to help them balance it out and chose what character trait that best represent him or her. which allow the person to identify what spirit animal is and identify which character trait the animal is. for insist,white tiger know for protect their pup like any mother would do as the same trait as our mom has show. choosing character trait could be tricky for everyone but it is important to be wise which character trait is best for you. you can choose which character traits,sometime it can lead to having great friend or loving family. but their will be a price to pay like if you are kind then someone will take avenge of you in order to trick or frame you. my opinion is to be strong and persist or sass but your pick add them long with your chosen character trait. character traits can be blessing in disguise and curse. as you see chosing your own character trait is better then someone influences you; it only cause problem and change you then your real self. although, i explain my reason:everyone has there own unique trait ,animal,lastly the price of choosing character trait. therfore i always said ""character trait can be beautiful but a curse in",2.5,2.5,3.0,3.0,2.5,2.5,3.0077364444732666,2.729095220565796,2.753552198410034,2.969857931137085,2.7975542545318604,2.787600040435791
"students have enough hours of school already! i strongly disagree about the school board adding more hours to school every day. i m not telling you this just because i m a student, i m telling you this because it doesn t just affect me, it affects other students in many ways too! this could bring students really bad behaviors, because they get tired of being in the same place for a long period of time. this could bring students grades down too, because students do not work the same when they are tired. if they added more hours to school, students wouldn t have time to do their homework or to study for quizzes and tests. this idea of adding hours to school does not just affect students, it brings problems to the teachers and the school. teachers have families and some of them have children of their own, this wouldn t let teachers to go home and pass time with their family. another problem i see in this it s that some students have appointments, just like me ! sometimes i have to go to my orthodontist, and my appointments are always in the morning, i have to go there every month. i always miss two or three classes, and when i get there i have a bunch of work that i missed! if they din t add those hours to school i could ask my orthodontist to do my appointments in the afternoon. sometimes students get sick, and if they miss one day of school they would have to do more work than the usual. this affects the school in many ways too! the school would have to pay more, because they would have to give the students more food than the usual. they would have to waste more money in paper, bathroom supplies and they would have to give the student a new agenda with more bathroom passes in it. the school would have to manage more conflicts and fights between the students. if they added one and a half hours to school they would create more car crashes and accidents in the roads, because the students would get out of school at the same time that elementary school students do, and then there would be a lot of school buses. students wake up pretty early, at least that s what i do. if the school added more hours they would get more than tired, the student wouldn t even learn the lessons or the teacher wouldn t even teach the lessons right. as you can see i listed many ways that adding hours to school affects students,teachers and the school. i think the school board should rethink this new idea they came up with. i think that they should hear other students points of view. i think i m not the only student that thinks that this is not a good idea because it affects everyone. and some other students think different from others. in conclusion i think that the school board shouldn t add more hours",4.0,3.5,3.5,4.0,4.0,3.5,3.854193925857544,3.9798977375030518,4.032358169555664,4.093684673309326,3.9733200073242188,4.043664455413818
"some people want to be the best example in life; however, not all of them can be. even the most famous and intelligent people that we can know is not the best example to follow because if we go and investigate their life they also have done things wrong. everyone makes mistakes and is alright in this world. i disagree with what albert schweitzer said. in fact my personal conduct is not the best way to act for other people to follow me because it is difficult being a good example and is better if we influence them differently. to begin it is difficult being a good example. everybody does good things in their life; however, there are some days where we do not feel good and by accident or because we want to do it, so we do things not right. for example: i do not like when my aunts talk to their daughters about me. my aunts explain them that i am a good example in my family because i have two jobs and i go to school and in my free time i prefer to stay with them at home than going out with friends that they do not know. i know the things they say are correts but i told them do not use me as an explample because now i am like that, but if tomorrow i decide to quit school or i do other things is not going to be the best example they are waiting for. some might say that it is easer having jobs and going to school and being a good example in your family because there are many people who does the same, but i know in reality is very difficult mostly if you are helping your family too. next is better if we influence them differently. not by being their examples but being as a guide to follow. for example: i have an aunt who had her first kid at her years old. now she is years old and she does not have more babies just the firt one. she tells to my cousins and i that it was the worse experience that she has not for her child but for her husband. she remembers everything that she lived at that age and how she had to deal when she can not have her baby because she was young and her body was not completely develop. later for her surprise she had to work and maintain her child and her husband because he did not work or do anything. now she cries when she tell us her stories, but my aunt says that she wants the best for us and she does not want it to happen to us. my aunt says that she is not the best example in our family because she did not obbey my grandparents, but she has learned many good things in life base in her experiences. some people may say that they are the best examples for their children even if they do things not",4.0,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.6485159397125244,3.6175525188446045,3.643221139907837,3.649366617202759,3.5626399517059326,3.575482130050659
"would it be surprising to know that kids learning at home helps them not stress out as much? stress is mainly caused by student getting to much school work that cannot all be handied in on night. every day kids complain about having too much homework and when working at home there is not any homework. allowing children to work on their own schedule helps them become more motivated to work. students being educated at school gaing more freedom to create their own schedule and their own rules. learning at home and not at schools helps kids succeeed and have better grades. one of the best thing about homeschooling is that it can be done at anytime, and anywhere. children have a flexible time schedule which means that the parents can help. the students can work around the parents schedule instead of the parents working around the student s schedule. some students have a trouble working at a school because they cannot understand the material at the pase set by teachers. homeschooling allows students to work at their own pace and on their own schedule. another thing about homerschooling is that there are no misguided rules about technology or how to dress. this is good because instead of worrying about the rules. the students can focus on their studies. when you are taking a test or taking notes at a public school there are many distractions that can make students lose focus on what they are doing. this is another reason that learning from home would benefit students. learning from home won t have the distractions that a classroom has. as a result of this, students won t lose focus on the work they are doing and get better grades. one of the reasons students get distracted in the first place is because they are in an environment their are not familiar with, which makes the feel uncomfortable. if a students learns from home they will feel more relaxed and confortable and won t stress about work. in a school, you are struck at desk for hours and have a limited time to eat and limited bathroom breaks. this is not help a student s learning at all. on the other hand. if you are at home you can eat and do whatever you want when you want. there are still a few reasons not to do distanced learning. there are many more opportunities with public schools. people from different colleges don t go to students homes and try to advertise their career options. making friends from home would be difficult without social interaction. public school are great places to socialize during free time. if everyone goes home to attend school funding for public schooling willl fall and teachers will lose their jobs because of buged cuts. in public schools, depending an the teachers, cheating is hard to do. my conclusion is students should be offered classes online or at home because the environment is less distracting, which could be less stressful. at home there are less distractions, rather than at school",3.5,3.5,4.0,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.889824628829956,4.393496036529541,4.447575569152832,4.115372657775879,4.258593559265137,4.402007102966309
"can failure lead to success? former british prime minister winston churchill once said that ""success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm."" many people who have dreams and goals would agree. if failure is on the road to success it will give motivation, thought of improvement, and an opportunity to have experience. failure doesn t always have to be a bad thing. failure will give people that push of motivation many need. if students fail once then they know they have to get up and keep trying. are many people just going to give up because they failed one time? let s say somebody is setting a high goal and fail; if that person sets a high goal they will have to understand failure will come in some part of that; it is a reach to get there. as soon as failure kick s in, so should the motivation. if not then nobody will be able to meet the goal of success they want. for example,student is walking into class and spent the whole night studying for this test. she turns it in and thinks she did well. turns out that it is the opposite. she has the chance to retake it and is taking the chance. sometimes expectations don t go the way people would like. that doesn t mean eventually the expectation won t get met. it just means to keep trying. another reason on why failure can bring success is because it gives thought of improvement. everyone knows the saying ""you learn from your mistakes"". that saying is very true. if something goes wrong because the way it was dealt with, will the same mistake happen again? of course not! people see when the mess up or fail after it happens and will try to do better. that is improvement and it s leading you to success. then we will know where to start and where to fix things. it s apart of succeeding. people who have succeeded can tell others than without at least one fail, they would not of made it to where they are now. last but not least, it gives you experience. if we didn t fail there would be no experience for the next goal. having that experience of failure will help. when the goal is met and finally succeeded then there will be an amazing story to tell. especially because failure was around. speak on the obstacles that were faced and how to get through without giving up. having this experience and speaking about it can influence others as well. maybe some people also have failed but they want to give up, encourage others that failing doesn t mean you still can t succeed. to conclude, failure can be a big step to success if used the right way. don t sit there and give up because failing is a way closer to the goal. use failure as motivation, thought of improvement, and an opportunity to have an experience. in this case, failure is a great thing.",3.0,3.5,3.5,4.0,3.5,3.0,3.841066837310791,3.839294195175171,3.9245457649230957,3.835859775543213,3.8333749771118164,3.8173258304595947
"it wouldn t even matter if the school lunch changes to healthy food. even until this day they still don t change to a heathly choice. students has tried to make the school lunch meals change, but there wasn t any difference. sometimes the studentst doesn t make good healthy food choice there will be times that the lunch menu will have healthy choices and not so heathly choices. for example: the lunches gives us two options one is pizza and the other rice with chicken, students will definitly go for pizza. it would be a good idea that the school lunches menu changes to a healthy menus. we do need to consider other students and their eating habbits, most students doesn t even eat, they even go a whole day without eating. if the school were to change the unhealthy food they should get rid of pizza, hot dogs, and chicken nuggets and make up for potatos with rice and chicken, a nice pasta salad with tomatoes, onions, and, spinich. some students are vegan so maybe they can have a veggie burger anything with veggies. if that s the case to change school lunch menu, the school should consider about how and where they should spend money on things like changing the floor tiles it s unnecessary it could have been for something better. no one really cares about how bad the school lunch is, it s not worst thing in the world. anyways thats why us students have to be smart and bring our own food to school like most of them do. in reality, it really doesn t matter because students still eat school food, some students do complain about how nasty the food is but they still won t bring their own food how logical is that. to be honest there are sometimes good lunches like we said before it s not best thing in the world. so it s okay don t waste on changing something when you knew it could of been done from the start. just bring your own food from home and you won t have worry about the school menu.",3.0,3.0,4.0,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.451876163482666,3.1940929889678955,3.129188299179077,3.353015184402466,3.071613311767578,3.2949106693267822
"dear, school board of education i personally disagree with the idea of adding one and a half hours of school. this is a terrible idea and here are some reasons why i disagree so please grab a seat, relax, and take your time to read this. the first reason why there shouldn t be extra school hours is students will have to walk in the dark. the second reason is students will have less time for sports and other after school activities and also less time for family and friends. and finally students will be sick of having school for a such a long period of time and possibly stop going to school. first of all not everyone is fortunate enough to have a ride to school but that doesen t mean that they can t go to school so they walk, but if the school board adds more school time students who walk will have to walk in the dark. walking in the dark could be very dangerous because you don t know whats in front nor what s behind you and that could cause students not to go to school anymore because they will be scared of walking in the dark and feel unsafe. another example of why it could be dangerous to walk in the dark is if someone is trying to cross the street and a car doesen t see them they ll probably get ran over and the school won t be responsible for the accident. something that also is good to keep in mind is that if the school hours get changed and even if you try to avoid students from walking in the dark there s a cost. you ll have to put street lights and that could be very expensive, and the money could be used for educational purposes. the second reason why extra school hours shouldn t be added is students won t have much time for sports or other after school activities. sports and school are both important and they both should be equally balanced. so if school gets longer than maybe we ll have less time to see our family and friends. i remember when i did football practice was getting shorter and shorter because winter came, and during that time it was also raining a lot and snowing a lot so we missed a lot of games and practices, imagine if school was an hour and a half long, there wouldn t even be a football season at all. the last reason why an extra hour and a half of school is a bad idea is because, a lot of students would get really sick of school and stay home or try to get suspended so that they don t have to got to school. we ve all been in that situation where we don t want to go to school so we pretend we re sick, even i get tired of having to go to school every day, in fact i don t really want to be here right",4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.5,3.8321008682250977,3.9140374660491943,3.9467368125915527,4.099811553955078,3.8913958072662354,3.9361984729766846
"a lot of people think that positive attitude is the key to success in life. i think that having positive attitude in life is the key to success, and you might ask your why. i think that having a very formal manger and attitude in life will get you a long ways in life then being grumpy and mean toward other people. that s why there is a saying teat people the way you want to be treated. therefor you will get the same amount of respect that you put out there toward other people firstly, i do believe that positive attitude is the key to success in life. having all this positively and good energy will get you along way in life. why you might ask your self. having good positive energy will allow you to meet new people and they might want to interact with you for having good energy surrounding. secondly, this may allow you to meet new people. meaning they might would like to share with you on how they found the key to success. after that you would probably would like to share the key to your success, and how it helped you accomplish your goals that you might have thought that you never would. thirdly, this may lead you to the success in life that you have been dreaming about. that being millionaire or stepping up in your woke place etc. being joyful and happy in life will allow you to accomplish and allow you to work percent good. lastly, all i have to say is that positive attitude is the key to success in life. the only reason i say this is,because i was one of those students that didn t interact with anyone because of my attitude. now that i have learn and taught my self to be the person who i am today i have made so many friends that i didn t know i would talk. i didn t know that having all this kindness and positive energy could reflect on who i am today. that why i say have good strong positive energy and you will get a lot back in life",3.5,4.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.5,3.1406397819519043,2.9478180408477783,2.9698116779327393,3.0862367153167725,2.933382749557495,3.0103211402893066
"should young students commit to a career. i think young students should not commit to a career yet because their minds can change at any momment and if they commit to a career and if they start to not like the career they wanted they will wasted all their time and effert to that one career. also, if the class s for the career are defficult they and they give up halfway and drop out the class and never try again. so their goal to get the career they want is not in reach for them anymore. also, you may still not be ready to commit to a career because there are different things you may be into and like doing more then the job you want to do. however, some people may not feel the same way as me on this topic. people may think that is a good idea that young student commit to a career because they have an idea of what they want to do later in life and won t be stuck as may other students may be. i still think at students that are young should not commit to a career yet. so for my conclusion if you are in high school and if you don t know if you want to commit to a specific career don t because you can chage you re mind at anytime. also, you may not like the career you look into or may find it hard and give up and thats not a good thing to do.",3.0,3.5,2.5,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.069873809814453,3.0495173931121826,3.011826515197754,3.0521976947784424,2.9314684867858887,3.067965030670166

"i feel that working with a partner is more beneficial to students. working with partners gets students extra help when in need. it can make new friends while working on big projects. also it makes the work get done easier and quicker when working in big groups. i also personally think that any project with a presentation should be a group project. if that presentation has more than just the presentation it should be a three person group. working with a partner is beneficial to students, because it gives extra support or help on a project or classwork. if a project is too big and impossible for one person to complete they could split up the work. for example, when i had a final project in my english class; i separated the work with my partner. we had to do an essay and a powerpoint presentation. my partner did the essay and did the powerpoint presentation and we both finished in time. if i hadn t had my partner, i probably would not have finished the project in time. my teacher making it a group project made it way easier to do because i didn t have to worry about writing essay. another reason that working with partners is beneficial to students is that they can build new friendship while doing work. when students are doing work in groups, they are together the whole class and have to stay in contact outside of school. for example, when i was working on a video for my journalism class i had a very big video that was due in a few days. i made good friends with the people that were in that group because we spent the whole class together and staying in contact after school. every time i m making a video i want to work with them because i know they will do a good job. another way that working in partner benefits students is that it saves them time and makes them finish their work quicker. if the students split up their work and do their work efficiently they will finish quickly. the more group members will make it even quicker. for example, when i was working with a friend and two other students on a project for a book we finished the book very quickly and the book review was finished very quickly as well. when partners are helping each other it makes everything way easier and more fun as well, because you get to hang out with your friends while being productive. also if the teacher lets students pick people, they can pick people that know a lot about the topic of the project or classwork. for example, in when i had spanish we did a project about puerto rico and since i m from puerto rico everyone wanted to pick me. i went to a group where a good friend of mine was and the project was very easy to finish and present. the project was done so quickly that the next class we had free time",3.5,3.5,4.0,3.5,4.0,4.5,3.8656907081604004,4.012951850891113,4.185317039489746,4.127509117126465,4.000183582305908,4.095527172088623

"should students participate in extracurricular activities? there are many diffrenet activities for students, not only sports, but clubs and many more. there is other to life then school and activities. students should have the ability to choose what they want to do in the extra time they have. schools already take half of the students time with going to school and homework .i disagree that students must have an extracurricular activity because they could learn a new language, do better in school, and spend time with family and friends. first, students can learn another language besides their own. first, the language that they pick helps them with their applecation to colloge and in the real word. for example, it is more likely for a student that have two or three languages to be accepted in a colloge, unlike the student that only knows one. second, students could communicate with others around the world. for example, if they learned spanish, they can talk to others in spain or around other that speak the same language. third, they could be the only one that learned that language in your class or school. in conclusion, these were the advantges of learning a new language. second, teenagers that are struggling in school could take their time and have an advantage to be better in school. first, they could study for their coming exams and be able to focus on them. for example, students could make study groups or study buddies for studying better. second, after school students can get extra help from their teachers. for example, they would only focus on the students weak part on the subject. third, they could make up for the extra work they missed from their classes. for example, a student is sick or had a docters appointment they could make up that work at home after school. in conclusion, students would do better in school with the extra time they have. third, we need to spend time with family and friends. first, help your family with work around the house. for example, help your mom cook for dinner,or help your dad fix his computer,or help your siblings with homework. second, you could hang out with your old friends. for example, go to mall,watch a movie ,or go to their house. third, get to know eachother better. for example, play never have i ever, truth or dare,and many more fun games you could play. in conclusion, spending more time with family and friends could grow you a stronger relashionship. in conclusion, i disagree that students have to have an activity because students can learn a language, have better outcomes on their report cards, and have quality time with friends and family. these were some reasons to not have an extracurricular activity. the principal should not force any student that do not want to do an activity make them. students must have their own right to do what the want. go stop extracurriculars!",4.0,3.5,3.5,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.741096019744873,3.978708028793335,3.993891954421997,3.830634593963623,3.912773609161377,3.79396390914917

"do you ever just wonder how school would be like if you could pick your own classes/electives? my opinion is that students should not be required to take a music, a drama, or an art class. there are many reasons why i think the above. sudents are capable of choosing whats best for them and what they like to do. counselors or teachers should not be picking students or electives. student want to be taking or doing many things that they are into to. i think that music, drama, or an art class should be electives. strudents are capable of choosing whats best for them and what they like to do because they want to do what intesrests them. for example, i do not like to take music, it bores me. i would rather take drama. people are very diferent from each other. such as music, drama, and art should be extra credit for students that are interested in thiose kind of electives/classes. we just need to give students a chance to do their own things and be choosing their own kinds of thing. counselors or teachers should not be picking students electives. the reason why i think this is because all electives should not be classes in general. for example, some people like math, instead of students taking an art class, ect. they can be taking another math class. if thats what they love learning about because with art, we cant do anything with it in the future. which in math we mostly use it and need it in everything. students want to be doing many things that they love in school. yes, that is very true. classes that are for fun should be electives!! not required. we should just think about what we like to do best. everyone should be able to pick their own classes. in conclusion, music, drama, and art should not be required. student like to do what they like best. counselors/teachers should be picking those classes for us.",2.5,3.0,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.0,3.451124668121338,3.331637382507324,3.284195899963379,3.322152853012085,3.2922861576080322,3.3777105808258057
"hilary clinton, soccer players, people in the government everyone had failed once in their life time. everyone is not complete. we are humans we make mistakes and we fail. failure without loss of enthusiasm is the best thing people can do. we gain experience by failing. we learn not to give up and chase our dreams. we learn how to be patient and deal with problems. we never know when is the best time to do something or to get something so be patient. my parent told me that""good things will come to you just be patient"" although, after failing once most of the people lose hope and stop trying. nevertheless, it is not easy to start over because it gets boring working on same thing over and over and people give up on their dreams. to begin, failing help people to gain more experience. when we do same thing over again it makes our work easier. for example when we fail the test at school and we have to retake it we already know what mistake we did for the test so we do not repeat it. this shows that we will try harder when we get the chance to do it again. clearly we will be successful next time. furthermore, we learn not to give up when we fail for the first time. giving up is not the best thing to do after failing. for instance, we can make a whole new plan and ways to do our work. this shows that we are going to be successful next time. for example, when i was i had to take a test in order to get in to the high school that i wanted but, the test was hard and i failed the test i said i will not take it again because it is hard and i can t do it but my sister said that i can t give up and i have to take it again and again and finally i pass the test for the second time. moreover, it teaches us to be patient. when we fail it is the best thing for us to wait for the good time to start over and to get what we want. obviously, it will take time to start all over and do everything one by one but it will help us to learn how to be patient and to deal with problems better than before. clearly we will get what we want sooner or later after trying hard. overall, failure is a key to success. we will not get to success if we do not fail once. it is not something to be ashamed of. in conclusion, gaining experience is the gift of failing. we start working hard and not to give up. we learn to be patient and chase our dreams. the best thing we can do is to be happy and joyful even after failing. everything has it s own time so be patient.",4.0,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,4.0,3.44184947013855,3.863149404525757,3.8128888607025146,3.5257723331451416,3.67928147315979,3.732694625854492

"do we choose our character traits, or is our character formed by influences beyond our control? some believe people choose their own character traits and who they want to be. others believe that our character is formed by influence. i think we choose how to make our own character traits and we choose the attitude we want to give to others. this is important because our character is what represent us and is what makes us responsible for the person we chose to be. first, people have the power of choosing who they want to be and producing their own attitude. for example, characteristic is important because is the quality, or property of us and it is what makes us committed to keep moving on the person we chose to be and different from others. furthermore, i believe that people should choose their own character traits even though if they think that is formed by influences beyond their control. perhaps some people should do the effort to change it because not everyone have a good and nice character. additionally, a person s personality is the collection of emotional and behavioral traits that characterize them. personality and attitude is the key to be a role model for others to become a great person and care more about whether we choose wisely our character we re giving to other peoples. people s humility and kindness is priceless. personality and attitude is what represents us and what makes us noble. for example, people can think that our own character traits is formed by influences but they still change it and do the effort to be a better person everyday. however, not everyone agrees with this position. some people claim that our character is formed by influences beyond our control. if we do not choose our character traits and they are formed by influences beyond our control, it might have its disadvantages. for example, one must consider that there are people who have a bad character and end up alone because of their attitude, also their character can brings other people displeasure and make them go away and not get close to you just because they think you will never change your character but our character will be what we, ourselves choose to make it. in conclusion, i think choosing our character, personality, and attitude is what makes us a humble and noble person to look up. i also think that some people should focus on the attitude they are giving to others and analyze if its what they would like to receive from someone else and if it brings them displeasure, perhaps it encourages them to change a bad character for a good personality and attitude.",4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.5,4.0,3.9002320766448975,4.035400867462158,4.132005214691162,4.102002143859863,4.032911777496338,4.0914177894592285

"changing the cafeteria food for students would be like taking a bone away from a dog. one of the reasons why changing the school lunch would be a bad idea is because, students that attend the school would not be happy with the change. when students are unhappy with changes of the schools sometimes parents can get involved and that brings a bad reputation for the school board. one day i was watching a show and they were making school changes without the students or parents consent and it turned into a big thing. students were so angry the went on a ""strike"" and refused to go to school. another reason why taking away students favorite food would be a bad idea is because students would stop eating at school. for example, when i went to a family dinner they made meat loaf and i absolutely hated it, i couldnt bring myself to finish it and i felt extremely bad but i had to throw it away. another example is also similar to my last one but, one day my friends and i went to a buffet and they didnt have a lot options to choose from, we ended up getting these wings and it was just awful we could not eat it all. when people see things they do not like then they most likely will not eat it or even try it out. lastly, changing the cafeteria food would leave students with less options to choose from. it would be unfair for those who dont like what they are serving and they would have nothing else to eat. look at it like this, its like when you go out to your favorite shopping store and they have taken out all the clothes you loved so much about that store and they replaced it with clothes you hate. you would be very unsatisfied if that wouldve happen to you. thats what students would feel if the school lunch were to change. some people say that changing to a healthier school lunch would be a lot better for students; although, this is a good point, its wrong because it misses the fact that some students would be unhappy with this decision. these are some reasons on why changing the menu would be a bad idea for the school.",3.5,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.890383243560791,3.949925422668457,3.864114761352539,4.07088041305542,3.8179104328155518,3.8787007331848145
"a wise man once said the usage of technology has had an impact on humans contact for centuries .the usage of technology has had a positive impact with human contact because people can see what others are doing for fun and it can result in finding people that are from other countries to become your friend. sense technology has improved through out the th centuries people argue that technology has caused limitations on human contact but that is far from being right. people have been brought closer thanks to the invention of the internet and it wouldn t have happened if technology wasn t improved. the internet has opened a whole new world of opportunities and awesome people to meet. people can laugh at a funny mems together and create groups where their you can talk about what ever you want. people can even ask others if they would like to be friends with you. having the internet,people become more confident in being their true self. people can see how much fun a family is having and it can persuade them to go and try the place and experience the fun for themselves. with technology people have learned how to do things by watching videos of someone else doing it or by calling a friend. video games have also has let to people having to talk on the mic and being able to comunicate with each other. people can also build their sense of being a leader as they play a game they can ask people to saty with each other. thanks to technology people can have online teachers and people who would do online courses say for instance if you didnt learn a lesson you can go online and find a somone who would eplain to you or tell you how to solve a problem. some may argue,that technology has a negative impact on human contact because it distract others from the real world. how ever,people still have human to human contact its just evolving and becoming something different. in conclusion,technology has had a positive impact over these years and i will keep improving an the people will have better ways to have human contact.",3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.8799285888671875,3.779416799545288,3.8192837238311768,4.063340663909912,3.792903184890747,3.8749003410339355

"author ralph waldo emerson wrote,""unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow.""i disagree with the author ralph waldo emerson because if you have already try to do something more than you have already mastered, you will grow because now days there is too much competition in everything for examples companies,schools and sports etc. i think if you try to do something more than you have mastered will make you more better than you are because if you have mastered in something it will not be a bad idea to practice more even you know everything because everyday somebody is getting good by watching people those have mastered everything so when they go against them they will beat the master because they already know whats the master is going to do and they will try to protect themselves. here are some examples when people play video games like fortnite people be watching streamers from youtube and twitch to get better and learn some new moves and after watching them for some weeks they know what they are going to do next and how they going to play at any bad or good situation here are some example like apple is big company and samsung is a big company they both have some bad relationships like apple always make a good phone which is always better than samsung but samsung try their best to make a better phone than apple so, samsung has been trying to make better phones then apple by trying to copy their features for examples the screen size, the gb, and motherboards. only reason apple is making better phones because they have mastered everything and they are still making some new technology which samsung might not able to make in next two or three years and here is a another example they are so many cars in the world for example mercedes and lamborghini they both are good cars mercedes is a old company so they know everything about the car the way the want to make it luxury or fast and for example mercedes is a fast and a luxury car where lamborghini is a fast and luxury car, here is a last example like your coach if you play sports you need a coach which is going to teach you how to play and teach some moves that you can use to beat your enemy and make you strong and tell how to dodge some stuff when they try to hit you for example people play boxing and for new people they hires coaches which help them to learn how to play and stuff. and teach you how to defend your self from getting hit on your face or hitting him back. the conclusion is yes, i disagreed with the author ralph waldo emerson wrote,""unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow."" and you need to practice everyday dont matter how good your there is a lot of completion out there and",3.0,2.5,2.5,3.0,3.0,2.5,3.230098009109497,3.1281518936157227,3.1136879920959473,3.2574689388275146,3.1517584323883057,3.0932986736297607

"i think high school offer those programs to young students that wants to graduate in early age and other students take this programs, because they want to graduate to continue with college or work to help their families. in other cases students just took these courses because they don t likes school . but however their are always students that decide to complete high school in four years to have full credits to go at the best colleges. these students that take high school in four years are more prepared to colleges and they have more probabilities to get a better job. for me take school in three years is a bad choice, because you learn a few less. examples:if you take school in three years and if you don t have the result that you wanted than you are gonna think that was a bad choice in your life. conclusion: students would take the traditional four years of school and enjoy the young age at school. than after the four regular years, it s time to think about what they want to do with life work or continue with college.",2.5,2.5,3.0,2.5,2.0,2.5,3.5651893615722656,3.287844657897949,3.3687548637390137,3.5173423290252686,3.280078172683716,3.4190587997436523
"conserving energy and resources by attending less days to school. adopting a four-day school week and only adding two more hours; each day consisting of nine hours. it will help to reduce the consuming of energy and resources. as we go out everyday to complete our duties in the school s building, we consume energy from the sky lights and others useful lights, the computers, and laptops. also the food students receive in school as a lunch. plus students frequently purchase gas to come to school; due that some students need to come in their own cars or public buses, because they don t live around the school area. additionally students that are currently having a part-time job will be able to work more. in the case of student who are not working in a part-time job would get one more day added to the weekend, and they would be able to spend more time doing family activities or having a good time with friends, and close people. to start with, reducing the consume of energy will help with our planet; energy is produced with some elements and one of them and a very important one is: water. the less energy we use or waist the less will be the affect for our planet. adopting the four-days school week will make all of us stay at home on fridays and reduce the energy use from the school when using lights, computers and laptop that need to be charged. secondly, if students come to school only for four days, the food that they usually obtain on fridays will be saved and use for the next monday; that way saving food will start to be a good benefit for conserving resources. also some students come to this school but they living in a different city not closely to school; they purchases gas every week and they have to spend money, therefore if they only come for four days a week; they will saved gas for the weekends or for the next week of school. that s one of the best ways to conserve cars energy and resources; due to that gas use petroleum to be produced and other substances and chemicals that come from our planet soil grounds or others areas. lastly, students will obtain benefit by adopting this for-days school week as well, because the students that are currently working in a part-time job will obtain the opportunity to work a full day on fridays, they will be able to increase their revenue. in the case for students that don t have a job, they will have extra time to do homework, projects, and family activities as well. even thought, they are students with a different point of view, when it comes to adopting a four-day school week. they argue that adding two more hours to the regular school day, will be more exhausted and they will have less hours to work in their part-time jobs. in conclusion, adopting a four-day school week will help to conserve energy and resources. firstly: conserving energy",3.0,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.804145097732544,3.849072217941284,3.8426430225372314,4.075376033782959,3.8868870735168457,3.869124412536621

"it has been said that a positive attitude is the key to success in life. there is a lot of benefits of having a positive attitude which are health or physical improvements, how to solve a problem, and the power that exists inside you. the benefits of optimism extend beyond stress relief better health, more rewarding relationships and enhanced productivity. people with a positive outlook tend to experience are reduced incidence of depression, lower stress levels and are better able to cope with stress causing events, an incresed life span and overall better health. people with a positive outlook on life are also more likely to live healthier lifestyle, and to smoke cigarattes less and drink less alcohol. attitude is the way taht we behave and we react to the daily activities, consequently a positive attitude may influence our life and it aspects in a deep way such as how we think, socialize, and even how our health is. all these aspects might be affected by a positive attitude. actually it is proved that successful people have been influenced by the way they see the circumtances in their life. in other words, successful people see those circumtances with a positive attitude and they see those circumtances as a challange to beat and not like a punishment to suffer. therefore, these people will be more likely to fight and have success in their life, rather than the ones who see their life as a punishment. positive attitude might be the key to all the people who want to fulfill their dreams. if everyone would apply these concepts in their lives, they would become happier because they will see that everything including their life, situations, and problems, is under their own control. even though there are some people who wonder how to get a good positive attitude, is not simple to get it. almost every single person that has has a positive attitude is because tehy have had a motivation or a feeling that supports their fight to reach their goal or achievement. when you have a positive attitude, you feel that there is a power inside of you that motivates you to do something or to get involved with something. these people are most commons to have best attitudes of this world. having a positive attitude can lead you to the lighter, braver and stronger way to stand against negative attitude.",4.5,4.5,4.5,4.0,3.5,4.0,3.8910140991210938,3.9755311012268066,3.9422824382781982,4.11095666885376,3.959660053253174,4.068864822387695

"school districts should not allow high school students to graduate in three years instead of the traditional four years. those programs force the students to take summer or evenings courses, don t allow them to take elective classes, or students might not have the time that they need to be prepared for college. this information can help students to think more about their decitions, and have a successful life. summer, or evening courses can always be stressful for some students. sometimes, they will not have time for family activities, or they might not have the opportunity to get involved in sports that they like, which is a good way to spent time with other students. it is also very important to know that students need time to rest, a free time when they can sleep and release the tiredness. the elective courses during the school year should be available for all the student that wish to improve their knowledge. for example, learning other kind of things can encourage students to think about more ideas for their future, and develop new skills on many activities. taking away the opportunity of students to choose any of elective courses, and forcing them to complete all the hard classes that they need is not a good solution. that will make students to force themselves to do hard work, which can end up in a failing situation. in other words, its very important for students to be prepared for college. also students should have the sufficient time to prepare, and choose the career that they really want. if in case students are not sure about what career they want, four year of high school should be enough time to learn more about carrers. for example, students will have more opportunities to attent college day also, they could go visit, and get information about any college that they are interedted on. being well prepared is the best key to bulid a good future nad accomplish dreams. this decition should be made by the school district to eliminate this programs, and let the students have a comfortable schedule for thier everday activities. spending more time at home with family, and refreshing their minds it s better than summer courses. students should know that getting involved in elective classes is more fun, and bieng well prepared for college is more important. even though students know it s going to be a longer way, it would benefit them in the future.",4.0,4.0,4.0,4.5,4.5,3.5,3.7691752910614014,3.7523064613342285,3.8087663650512695,3.807924747467041,3.7240912914276123,3.6827385425567627
"yesterday, i was talking with my parents and they tell me that i have to start thinking about what career i want after i graduate from high school. i start seeing what issues can cause and i think that it is bad idea to select what career i want at this age, because whats is going to happen if i don t like the career that i choose when i was younger or if that career is going to give me the money that i m looking for and what about if my parents are not in conditions to help me pay the career that i want, after think all this i meet with my parents again and i tell them the reasons that why i don t want to select my career at this time. the first reason that i think why is not a good idea to select my career at this age was, what is going to happen if i select one career but after four or five years later i like other career and i really want to be in the other that its totally different from the one that i select five years before, maybe they are going to get mad at me because they are going to say that am just wasting my time or something like that and i don t want that i want to be sure about the career that i get is going to really like me when i get older. the second reason was, who know s that is that career is going to help me in my economy because some career with the time they lose demand on the thing that they are doing and they give you fire or reduce your salary, but if i take my time to think and analyze all the careers that i like that can be better, because everyone wants a job that can provide a good salary and a good benefits and thats what i want, in that way everything is going to be more secure for me that nothing of that issues that i said before is going to happen and my economy stays in good conditions. and the third reason that i think was, what about if i select my career and my parents after the four years that we have to do in high school they don t have the opportunity to help me pay my career and i ready get very excited that s is going to get me very nervous because i didn t think about what other career i want to do. this is why i want more time to think about it and see if my parents can help me to pay the career that i choose, in this way me and my parents don t get frustrated, i for having multiple choices of what careers i like and my parents for paying something that they can afford with their money. in conclusion, i think that it is a really bad idea to let young kids",4.0,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.5,2.971647024154663,2.792928457260132,2.83514404296875,2.9338247776031494,2.7228877544403076,2.848043203353882

"if in high school should young students be capable of committing to a career. some adults say that young students should pick a career. others say that they are not ready to choose and commit to a career. i believe that students should commit to a career at a young age. the age shouldn t determined how committed you can be to a career. being young shows a lot of both positive and negative benefits. early experience for these students can benefit future jobs. for example, you take a class for cooking and seek for a job you will have a better chance then those who have no experience. starting your career with prior knowledge before becoming an adult will make it easier to obtain a job once you graduate high school. those who choose to wait after high school will have a harder time seeking a job. your chances for a job are much higher then those without any experience. making less mistakes because of all the prior knowledge you learned beforehand. for example, you take a class for cooking and you start learning early how to stop from burning your food. so, when you start cooking at a restaurant you will know how to stop from ruining the food. starting young will prevent less mistakes from happening in your future job. this gives the students a better resume if they know what they are capable of doing and doesn t need to be taught. having less mistakes during the job will show your bosses that you know what you are doing for them. the students will have some confidence before going into their career. for example, you learn about the kitchen and what everything does so when you go in you won t expect anything new. this will help students have some confidence since they know what to expect going into they re career. before entering a career it s good that students can relax and feel better since they know how everything will go. a boost of confidence is what students need before going into something. on the other hand, people say that having students commit to career in high school is a bad idea. for example, students are constantly changing there mind and changing there interests. some adults say they are to young to commit to a career because of how uncertain they are when they make decisions. so, they think how can a student choose something for the rest of there life if they can t decide on some of the most simplest decisions. those adults think that students should wait until they are older to make that type of decision. having students start early come with so many benefits for there future. they get to learn more in advance then the rest. also they have better oppurtunites and better chances with getting there perfered career. that many positive outcomes will come out of starting early. so, i believe that students can commit to a career at a young age in high school.",5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.868643045425415,4.03184700012207,4.12430477142334,4.125625133514404,3.9815175533294678,3.9657843112945557
"the idea of creating a new menu for the cafeteria affects people who are trying to have a healthier diet, and kids who need to be clean of bad supplements for the sports season. otherwise, students that come to our school since freshman year love the tradional food of the cafeteria. it is a good idea to include the new recipe of food in the cafteria menu because, it will have more types of vitamins, proteins, and all type of good suppliments that a young healthi body needs. also, teachers agree that would be a good upgrade for the students to have a extra meal that is healthier and it is in a good quantity. if the changing in our menu happens, the students that do sports will have a second meal to support all the exercise that is needed for the soccer teams, football, etc... in some others opinion, the new menu in the cafeteria will affect the businness in our school, beacuse the students that are in the school for a longer time will not like to change their favorite types of food. some students might not agree with the changing of the recipe in the cafeteria, but for those reasons, the principal and teachers agree that the new menu would be a healthier and more elaborated meal for everyone in our school.",3.5,3.0,3.5,3.5,4.0,3.0,3.5063886642456055,3.20178484916687,3.3388466835021973,3.3587658405303955,3.2459909915924072,3.3292555809020996

"nowadays many students become involved in extracurricular activities to enrich their educational experiences. there is a debate if school should or should not control students involvement in extracurricular activities. some people think that students should be more involve in extracurricular activities. however, i think that the decision regarding extracurricular involvement should be left to students and their families because students will have to much pressure on their shoulders, students will not have enough time to complete school assignments or study, and students have to work. one reason, why the decision regarding extracurricular involvement should be left to students and their families is that students will have to much pressure on their shoulders. they will be always worrying about school stuff and the fact that they have to spend a lot of time in extracurricular activities. spending to much time on extracurricular activities can led students to a depression. they will not get enough rest because of not doing anything else ,but extracurricular activities. students will get tired that they would not want to do anything else. students another reason, why the decision regarding extracurricular involvement should be left to students and their families is that students will not have enough time to complete school assignments or study. students will have little time to study for a test or quiz. evidently, not having enough time to study can led students to fail their classes. students will not turn homework or projects on time. students deserve to have extra time to study. final reason, why the decision regarding extracurricular involvement should be left to students and their families is that students have to work. students work to be independent. students work to pay for their future education. students work to help their families financial. students work to achieve their future goals. they work to not have a miserable life in their future. work will give them more opportunities in their life. to conclude, for these reasons and so many more is why i think that the decision regarding extracurricular involvement should be left to students and their families. students will have a lot of pressure, students will have lack of time to study or finish with their homework, and students got a job. schools should think a little bit more about student s responsibility and how controlling students involvement extracurricular will impact their life. i know that the education is very important ,but student deserve to make their own decisions.",4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.746307611465454,3.464585542678833,3.5531485080718994,3.670344114303589,3.4837424755096436,3.480024576187134
"some school offer distances learning as an option for student to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. i think student would not be benefit if they had distances learning. many student would not focused during the lesson they would just do whatever they want so they won t learn as much as if they had a teacher. if student had online classes they would not get the attention necessary if they need help. some student often have a bad day so they often don t pay attention and they just don t do the work that is assigned to them. they often just search the answer without learning but they think that s okay because no one is watching them. many of them don t learn the subject but still somehow they passed the class. other important, reason why student won t benefit from online classes is that the may have some big problem in their life and they need someone to talk to but their one home so they feel sad, but if they were in school they can talk to a teacher,coach,counselor, or any other they feel happy to talk too. other student may be sad they don t have someone to talk too. online classes don t benefit students because they don t have the help they need. when student take online they can paid someone to do their work, and pretend that they did the work. one reason they can ask their brother to the work for them so they are not really learning anything. other example, student may request some extra help but they won t get it because they don t a teacher with them. so they just don t understand but when it comes to do the text they failed. other example might be that they are having family problem so they won t do the online classes. and they would not be focus. having online classes won t help student in their life. one example is that they won t have friends and when they go to the real world they are going to have trouble talking to people because they don t know how too. other important reason why school should not have online classes is that many student need to talk to a counselor for that they want to be when they grow up. and most. most counselor guide their student the right way they teach the career we want to have in our life. but they take online classes they don t have the opportunity to chat with them. when students get video conferencing they don t really understand because something the video don t really explain what the student want to learn. one reason is the student might feel lazy to replay the video so he does not understand. and if he was at school teacher would help them with all their work . school should not have video conferencing. student are going to feel bad when they get older that they took online classes..",2.5,2.5,3.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,3.237083911895752,3.0351030826568604,3.0887436866760254,3.2552480697631836,2.9712445735931396,3.123194694519043

"it has been said that a positive attitude is the key success in life, that having a good thinking about what you do, and be proud of it is important. well, in my opinion it is the only thing, because time is going forward, and not backward, things that you have already done cannot be changed, but by having a good attitude about it you change your future, like being successful in your goals, solve economy issues, and even in day to day life. a positive attitude is really important when it comes to achieve your goals, if you want something but you think you can not make it, it is because you do not have enough attitude, in order to be successful with it, you must forget all the negative thoughts, and believe in yourself, and after all the effort you have been giving you will be a little bit more closer to achieve your goals. sometimes money can turn your life real hard, it can make you stop trying for what you want, and make you give up; is in this kind of situations when a positive attitude must come in, let me give you a personal experience: i used to live with a stepfather, my mom, and five brothers. at that time bills and debts were easy to pay, my stepfather was making around $ , dollars a month, my mom like $ , dollars a month, and my brother and i around $ dollars a month, all these money was the house income, but after my mom and her ex husband divorced, everything changed, now we had all those bills on us, but because we did not give up, and we had a positive attitude about the situation, we started to work even more, now my mom is single, and we can make trough out the month. another good example is living every day with a positive attitude like at work, at school, at home, even restaurants, it does not matter where you are right now it is important to always have a positive attitude, it is crucial in life to be proud about what you are, where you are, how you are, be the one who makes the change. some people say that because you did something wrong in the past, it is impossible to make a change about it, but they are wrong because they might not able to change the past, but for sure they can change the future by fixing and understanding in what they have failed, the attitude is important be proud of everything you have done and do not be ashamed. in conclusion, it is really important to have a positive attitude because to be able to achieve your goals you must have to have a positive attitude, money can make it hard for you to live, but you have to think and analyze the situation, wherever you go remember to have a good attitude about yourself, and never be ashamed about something you did wrong remember that you always can make",3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.5,3.0,3.6799659729003906,3.719996690750122,3.5814976692199707,3.8537380695343018,3.61484432220459,3.6585910320281982

"""i want to be a singer!"", is what i told everyone, at years old, i wanted to become someday. as i kept getting older, i started exploring more career opportunities that i could achieve someday and my interest started to grow. with high school and the programs and opportunities that they give us, it is tough to choose between the one i want the most. i wouldn t want to risk any of my hard work into a career that i would end up disliking. with that being said it would be a huge honor if i you could give me the opportunity to visit and get to know about the work that interest me. while many students at my age have already decided what career they want, i am not sure enough to make a decision yet. however, i know that this program will help me decide what is best for me in the future, by learning the skills and requirements to the career i may be interested in. this program would help me sign up for events, classes or even trips to the road of my success. in fact, even by talking to someone with the career i am interested in would help my knowledge. also, it would help me narrow down between which career i would most likely succeed in. the dedication there would have to be behind getting to where i belong to with your help, wouldn t be a problem at all. with the skills i have already learned with being in high school, i would already know how to manage my time with my career and real life. your help wouldn t go to waste but would lead me in the right direction to my future. on the other hand, this career might persuade me to become an artist and not to have given up on that dream i once had. i am pretty sure that if you and of course, myself see an improvement in getting involved with music, and having a huge passion, you could help other dreamers like me in the future. most importantly, by helping them find the right path for them. once the choice has been made and there has been improvement with the work i have put in and also being sure with what career i want in my future, i would gain more passion and inspiration. this would help me to push until i have accomplished everything i have worked for. i couldn t of made it without this program though, this company could help me a lot if you give me the chance to show you that it would be guiding me in the right path. with the opportunities you give, that not everyone sees, i may become one the greatest artist in this generation. i am hoping you really consider the motivation i have behind this, to do whatever it takes to explore my options out in this world. with that being said, it would be an honor to have the opportunity to explore the options in",4.0,4.5,4.5,4.0,4.5,4.0,3.8712921142578125,4.256431579589844,4.242345809936523,4.1082539558410645,4.201920032501221,4.411391258239746

"although it may seem like being active helps us accomplish more is better, but it s actually true that inactivity also serves a purpose to. three reasons why i think being inactive is that i have time to rest, i can catch up on any t. v shows, or i can hire a butler to do the cleaning around my house. some people are always being active and have no rest: thats not good because the human body is not used to so much work being done. i think in a certain point of life inactivity will serve a purpose because people will be tired of all the work hey done and will just want to rest. while being inactive there will be time where you can rest. last year when i worked, i was so tired of the job i had received because i was hot and thirsty out in the sun all day picking up trash. then one day when i was off, i spent my whole day resting. this served me a purpose because i was able to rest and get my energy back up to work another time. when i was resting i slept up to about hours because i was very exhausted, and gloomy. while i was resting in bed i had time to catch up on bills and any other things that have to do like call in an order for some groceries. resting this day helped me catch up on everything i needed on weekends, when i m at home and i m lazy some times i call a butler to come to my house and clean everything. there is a show named jessie, and on this show they have a personal butler named bertrum, and he travels with them also: he cleans up for them, cooks food, and he even has to open doors for them. this helps them because while they are trying to rest he is doing mostly everything they need to do. in my opinion, i think he s doing too much work than he is supposed to because it can be overwhelming. jessie and her kids are very lazy because they basically make bertrum do everything; that serves a purpose but then not because bertrum will be exhausted all time. when resting at home i have a chance to catch up on t. v shows that i like: like master chef, wild n out, and also real house wives of atlanta. no one can tell me to not watch it because i am going to be inactive and have a peaceful day where i have time to myself. the reason why i want to catch up on t. v shows is because, most of the time i dont have time because of work, or i ll be caught in a family emergency. overall, some people might think doing something will make you accomplish something isn t always true. in the world today there are a plenty full of people who are inactive, they sit there and do nothing but have",4.0,3.5,4.0,4.0,4.5,3.5,3.810427665710449,3.8104159832000732,3.7323219776153564,3.9985392093658447,3.8171939849853516,3.7545599937438965

"some schools have a program that have older students and younger students. the older students help the younger students with activities or homework. but how will this program help both the older and younger students? well, i will be telling you three things how this program is helpful for the older students and younger students. first thing is, the younger students will want some help from the older students because they know more than the younger students and it would be a great help. if this program is still going than more and more students will start joining in and they can start forming groups and they can each work on something different. secondly, this program can be very helpful by teaching students that are getting poor grades or poor scores on their test they re getting. students can even donate binders,books,folders,crayons,pencils,pens,paper,etc. even the students themselves can start their own fundraiser by making food and can raise money. lastly, this whole program can be very useful for the community and helpful for the students. this is why this program is so helpful and important for us student and adults in conclusion the older students help the younger students with activities homework/classwork. and that this program is really important to us.",3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.6126017570495605,3.506603479385376,3.473442316055298,3.6169331073760986,3.5566701889038086,3.5732717514038086
"have you ever wonder how many enjoyable activities are outside of the world? they re thousands of enjoyable activities outside the world. most people like to spend time with their families outdoors such as going to community parks, state parks, and national parks. not everyone likes to go outside to spend time with their family, or go to a place to have fun because they don t like to go outside that much, but most of the times you need to go and look around what s around the world. i would prefer someone should go to and spend time with their family, or just to have fun such as going to the zoo, going to disney or travel to a different state where you live. the first reason, why someone should go and have fun is to go to the zoo. most zoo s can be a little boring, but you can find a way to have lots of fun. the zoo can bring you lots of fun, and enjoyment such as taking pictures with the animals, giving the animals their food, and touching and giving love to the animals that are in the zoo. for example, at the zoo you can learn some interesting facts about every kind of animal that are you very interest in. also, giving lots of love to the animals like talking to them or touching them is a way to be relax. you can learn new things about animals and the history, and it can be interesting and fun at the same time. in my opinion, the zoo is a great place and a great activity to have fun. the second reason, why someone should go and have fun is to go to like a disney park. a large of number of people that i have known go to disney to have fun with their family members. for example, at a disney park you can go and try different games there, eat some different type of food that you haven t tried yet, and go and take picture of princesses that you really want to meet. for example, if you watch disney princesses, you can go and meet them in real life, and talk to them. also, going to disney and trying games or riding any type of game is going to bring you enjoyment. it will take you the stress that you have, and you will forget everything that you been going through. in my opinion, disney is the second best place to go and have fun by yourself or with the people that is around you. the third reason, why someone should go and have fun is to go and travel to a different state, or country that they have never been to. for example, going to the bahamas is a great place to go, looking at museums of what had happened in that place. also, going to the beach in the bahamas is another way to have fun, the beach is going to relax you in a type of way that you",3.5,3.0,2.5,3.0,3.0,3.5,3.735504388809204,3.659228563308716,3.6641762256622314,3.7871203422546387,3.6239802837371826,3.567995548248291

"i am agree with churchill s statement about the important role that failure plays in the pursuit of success. it is true that to be success first, you need to have a clear mind of what you want to be or to do. because in some of the cases can be very struggle and difficult to be success. for example, a very famous statement says, ""after the storm comes the calm."" this can be similar with the churchill s statement. because this explain that it does t matter how worst you see it but it would be great after the problems or you are struggle with. furthermore, to be successful you would pass by a hard things, for example something that people says, ""nothing is impossible if you don t tried."" and ""nothing is easy in this life."" this is a true statement that all people have to do and we have to know. additional, the word ""failure"" plays an important role to be success. one important thing is that if somebody loss her or his enthusiasm or will power can be worst because that means that you are giving up what you have already and for that you already worked for it and don t want to fight that victory of success anymore. sometimes you can fail but that does t matter because if you tried and tried again and again after you can get it. that would be one of your goals that you would remember. this shows how important is going from failure to failure to be success. finally, to be success we would failure first because by that you would know what you did wrong and thats why failure pursuit an important role in our life to be success.",3.5,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.5,3.0,2.7707622051239014,2.608713150024414,2.669039726257324,2.7500691413879395,2.650830030441284,2.6891448497772217
"should our school extend the school day two hours? no, i strongly disagree with extending two hours to school day. by extending two hours of school day, students for sure need to take a rest, take a shower, some students need to do chores, and also focus on their goals after school. if we extend two hours of school day, then students would not be able to focus on their education, because the brain cells need a break and need to refresh itself. furthermore, if there is days of school and days of no school, then students will forget what they studied days ago. in afghanistan, schools adopted a four-day school week, with each day consisting of ten hours. therefore, we are comparing the grades and attendance of students. with extending two hours of school day, this system had effect students educational life. students are not showing up to school and they skip school because of the new system. this idea had discrease the number of attendance and the grades of most of the students. finally, the regular school days and regular school hours are more beneficial then the new idea of extending two hours of school. if we want to focus and have good attendace, therefore we should not extend the school hours. in conclusion, we should keep the school days and school hours as it is.",3.5,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.5,4.5,3.7821335792541504,3.7024269104003906,3.8499341011047363,4.050373077392578,3.805734872817993,3.905078887939453
"if we think about the words that the british prime minister wiston churchill sait "" succes consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm."" there is a lot of truth is this words well that is what i believe. so how important is the role that failure plays in the process to reach success and don t loss enthusiasm in the proccess? in my opinion it is very important because it make us gain experience, improve our skills, and it make you feel comfortable and happy at the end. les t think about how you feel when your staring in the proccess to reach a new goal that you propose to youself it could be hard at the begin, because is your first time in that enviroment and maybe you have none experience there, and that could make you to fail some times and could be desesperate to you. you or people migth say, "" this is not for me,"" because you already fail a few time and you think but is just the beginc how will be the future. that could make you loss enthusiasm, but if you think what happend when you keep going with all this fails you re gaining a lot of experience during that proccess. for example, when i star to study at generic_school it was a big change for me staring with the lenguage, because i came from a coutry of spanish speakers and here the official lenguage is english, so i remember that in the begin my english was really poor, and i just knwe a few words in english like good morning or the name of some school s supplies, but everytime i did something wrong i learnd something new from that mistake wich make me gain experience in the proccess of my english learning. even if sometimes is embarasing to say or spell worng a word infront of people you will be learning to do it rigth with the time. therefore we should see the fails as a good oportunitie to gain more experience. most of the time you will notice some changes in yourself while you re reaching some goal, i m talking about the change on your own skills. that could be maybe improve some skills that you already had before or in the best of the cases developing a new one. using the last example that i used, when i star to learn english i remember that my speaking was the most hard part for me, because is hard to think a word first in spanish and then traslate that word in to english and also spell that word correct just on your mind. sometimes i started a sentence but then i couldn t finish it. that was so embarrassing for me, but with the time that problem has been decreased not all, but now is not like the begin. sometimes that happend to me again when i m doing presentation or when i m imfront of nwe people that i have never met. but i feel",2.5,2.5,3.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,3.1188035011291504,3.0125083923339844,3.0965542793273926,3.121441602706909,3.010383129119873,2.957350969314575
"i disagree with adding one and half hour to school each day because students would get tired and it would be more things to the students have to know. in our school we have hours of school and if we add it would have and i don t think students want to stay in school for a long time. i get that school is a place where you learn and school get s you a job and you can get a free scholarships to college without paying but at the same time students need hours maximum so they would fit all the knowledge and all the subjects in there mind. teachers want students to learn more because they want student s to have a successful life and learn more but student s have less time to listen because they want to go home .in our school we have subjects were we have tests and some students fail it because there studying for other classes even though it s not important like for example,elective classes,i get that elective is important to but students but it s really not important. the important classes are math,science and language arts, and history. the school board is not gonna like when students fail there tests when they have hours in school each day. students should have time when they get home to study so they can ace there test,since our school is a middle school we should have less hours so we can pass th, th and th grade without having any difficult in school. students wouldn t benefit if the time is longer they would not even pay attention to the teacher so i disagree with having one and half hour to school each day. on the other hand,i think i could agree to this because in order to become successful you have to study and work really hard and get enough to time to do your work. i think students would go to college if they had a lot of time and students would understand things better we should have a vote where students decide whether we should have one and a half hour or not so then the school board can see which one got the highest votes and they would decide if we should have a longer time or regular time. this year a lot of students are getting bad grades because there is so many tests and works they have to do and it s always do on time so i feel like we should have less time in school so when you get home you have a study time. the school board will like this idea because being in school for us is so much and there is no point for staying hours in school because teachers would get tired and students will get bored. students have a lot of work they have to do so it s better to stick with hours of school and let student s go home and do there homework and then read and study for",2.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.5,3.0,3.5399112701416016,3.2666680812835693,3.3318026065826416,3.4496142864227295,3.2539875507354736,3.2929608821868896

"michelangelo the artist once said, the greater danger for most of us lies not in setting our aim too high and falling short; but in setting our aim too low, and achieving mark. i agree with michelangelo statement because we want to aim our goal right, or we will ending up missing. however, there can be a better statement to explain this more. when people want to achieve their goal to be somone in life. it s like shotting a arrow to hit the middle, and aiming the goal we want. for example, to aim it at the middle you have to focus, believe, think, be positive, and let go of your arrow to aim your goal. other people would like a better statement , and also a better example to go with it. there are mostly people that take it serious to aim for their goal to be success. however there are some other that don t really care and just try to aim for their goal, and ending up missing their shot towards the middle. another example, is when people want to aim their goal they have to study , work hard, have faith, believe , take risk , be proud, and never giving up. but there s people that miss their one shot towards the middle. because they are lazy, not prepared, not focus, negative, not giving effort, and not paying attention for what goal their aiming for , so basically they will end up missing their only shot. third example, is people have to aim their goal just right not to high , and to low. the goal is to aim in the middle ,but micheangelo is right in one part because you only have one arrow to make it th the middle. it s mostly saying you have one shot to aim for your goal without making any miskates. i could understand why michelangelo said the greater danger for most of us is aming our goal target right in one shot. because there are some people that would have to take some risks. for example, they are not a citizen , or they don t have any papers to work , don t understand english well, they have to leave love ones behind, and get discriminated by their colors. and it makes it more difficult for some people to aim for their goal. for those reasons theirs fewest people s that end up missing there shot. but there are other people s that won t let this get in their way by taking the risk , and some of those risks come worth it at the end. for example , there are some people that get discriminated by how they look and their color ,but doesn t mean that they have to give up ,and point their arrow the wrong direction to miss their shoot to success. they have to show the others people that they can make their one shot towards the middle all because they study, work hard, put effort, being prepared, being positive and",2.5,2.5,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.387514352798462,3.203791618347168,3.2723166942596436,3.3860955238342285,3.252732276916504,3.280531406402588

"generic_name was running the fastest that she could, suddenly she cross the final line ; everyone was screaming from joy. most teenagers can t participate in any extracurricular activity for different reasons. for example, in generic_name experience was because she had to look after her brothers. occasionally teenagers look for ways to spend time doing what they like. in fact, there have been many cases where teenagers use a sport to feel less stress or to spend more time with their friends, for these reason teenagers should be able to participate in extracurricular activities. recently researches discovered that kids that are more active in their life-style can concentrate more than kids that stay in their houses doing nothing all day, like when generic_name was practicing the sport she start making new friends and loving the progress she was making every day. generic_name parents felt surprise because their daughter was following her dream. some parents think sports are a waste of time and that you are not going to needed in the future, although its going to help you in the future in many ways . for example, before generic_name was in the team of runners she felt tired all the time, but went she start practicing she was more active . most teenagers don t like sports, as a result of that the principal add more things you can do. know you can decide what do you want to do after school. i like the idea for students to participate in an extracurricular activities because students will have an activity to do after school and the will spend more time with there friends. if there is a student that don t have any friends this will help them make friends and learn new things. teenagers should do at least one sport or participate in other activities for their own good. do you participate in any extracurricular activities? why?",4.0,4.0,3.5,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.3067939281463623,3.4112677574157715,3.377281904220581,3.2507035732269287,3.439399480819702,3.3949201107025146

"people who value self-reliance define it as the need for each individual to follow his or her own instincts and ideas. i agree, because it gives them more experience to use their brains more, it makes people develop more, and it helps you from being dependent all the time. using your instincts gives people more experience to use their brains more. some people don t use their common sense to solve problems, because they re afraid that they re going to make it worse. it s okay to make mistakes. for example, if you re going on a trip with your family, and you find out that there s going to be a traffic in the morning, what will you do? wake up early in the morning before the traffic forms. that s how you use your brain. you think and plan ahead before things go bad. people developing more is great for your brain, because it makes you smarter and brighter. more ideas can be useful if you put your mind into it. for example, if you want your boss to be impressed by you, you need to act and use your instincts to create new ideas. it can help you be successful and more reliable. instincts help you from being dependent all the time, because you won t be able to be with your friends forever. you have to use your common sense to help you along the way to your adulthood. having a couple of friends is nice, but your going to have to act and deal with life yourself. for example, you re in your apartment and you need to pay a bill for your car. you re going to have to call the bank that you want to pay for that car. your friend does not need to tell you to pay for the things that you own. being independent is important in life. in conclusion: some say that people who value self-reliance define it as the need for each individual to follow his or her own instincts and ideas, because it gives them more experience to using their brains more, makes people gain more common sense, and it helps you from being around your companions all the time. counterclaim: not everyone can use their common sense, because they re not born that way. sometimes, people don t know how to be independent, or maybe they just don t want to. for example, those who have no sight can not see what they re doing. those who are deaf, cannot hear the people who are talking.",4.0,3.0,3.5,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.891167640686035,4.098598003387451,4.162261486053467,4.124474048614502,4.0861287117004395,4.071629524230957

"in some societies, students are expected to identify a career by the time they enter high school. their courses of study in high school are selected to guide them toward a specific career. i strongly disagree with this prompt because once we enter high school we are transitioning to a bigger school with more new subjects that catches our attention. my reasons for disagreeing is that i was once a rising ninth grader and i would be unhappy with the career i wanted in my freshman year. for example when i first came into high school as a ninth grader i wasn t sure of what i wanted to be once i graduate. now i am a senior at generic_school and i have two option to choose from. in my perspective i believe that at a young age mindset changes; you find new interest in things and also our mind isn t fully developed at ages fourteen or fifth teen; we aren t mature wisely on what we want. i think the student should started preparing them self once they re in junior year which is when they re a eleventh grader. my reason for saying that is because you re close to graduating and need to start planning your future, looking for scholarship, and making sure you want the career you ve chosen for a long period of time. i don t think its a bad idea but i wouldn t agree with it because i know how this generation is like and we need more teacher to start talking to them seriously about life after high school. these past year a huge amount of student have dropped out of school because they do not feel like they have support from teacher, friends, or even their own parents; or maybe the student think they can t afford college; not many teacher talk to them about financial help or support.",3.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.813241720199585,3.569249391555786,3.5507712364196777,3.9803671836853027,3.589616298675537,3.631349802017212
"people say working in groups is better than working alone, but thats their opinion even though it helps others more than it helps other individual s. i still know working alone is better because all my life i ve been working alone since sixth grade. i wasnt really the person to just jump in and meet others or ask for help when i needed them. every person has to go through many difficult times looking for a group but, their just too shy or too nervous to say a word to other people, i would know because i was in the same problem. it can be hard but, the reward is so worth it. people say working alone has no distractions, finishing faster than others, or learning things on our own. other individual s say that having no distractions can help them work without stopping but, sometimes there are many difficult situations where we cant do much to work while being distracted, maybe being in quiet place may help. finishing our work can easily be done without a group, like in our jobs, an office, or even at school. not everyone has a group to be in except for people that know each other , they have many people that wish to be in a group like them. back then when i was a little boy, i didnt know english so it was harder for me to understand teachers, or even students till i met two other kids that spoke the same language as me. i was happy to actually find two people that speak the same language as me but, that didnt last long because i never got to see them again. till then i worked alone, avoiding others, sticking close to myself, even studying alone without anybody. my mother or father couldnt help me as much. that made things worse for me. thats how i learned to do things all on my own without help. in a quiet place, we er able to finish other assighment s from our jobs or school work. teachers and students love to be in a quiet place because it helps them concentrate more than being in a group. in conclusion working alone is better than working in groups. next time try working on alone, in a quiet room.",3.0,3.0,3.5,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.7304978370666504,3.59883975982666,3.6381630897521973,3.765803813934326,3.5495083332061768,3.566164016723633
"according to the prompt i would have to agree because impression is something you get when you get to see a old picture of you when you was a kid, or when someone makes a surprise for you, you get that impression , you start crying or just smiling . for example,one of my experiences was meeting my whole family for the first time in my life, when we came to the united states my first impression was that i saw a lot of new things , a lot of nice cars , big houses , and a lot of people. we stayed in texas for days, we call my uncle the first day we stayed in texas, he told everyone in my family that we made it , we took different buses like for days just to get to were my family was. when we get there they went to pick us up , my first impression was to see all my family back again and that impression i will never forget it , and it will be never be change. we went to my grandmother s house, i was nervous because in that day i haven t see my dad for more than years, and when he came through the door i got that impression of seeing him again, i was so happy to see him again.",2.0,3.0,2.5,3.0,3.0,2.5,3.1451644897460938,3.073579788208008,3.0086729526519775,3.1488428115844727,2.9100730419158936,3.0667614936828613
"yes i agree with this quote, beacuse every students have a chance to learn, so in my opinion, i think that is a great opportunity, for all of them to learn. some of them has a job, maybe with that same job. i think some of them they have a chance to surpport they family. maybe they leave lonely, far aways from they family, or they have to help theire parent pay the rent, or other stuff to pay in they own too. i think they will have a benefit from being able to attend classes from home, because the schools give them a new way to progress. first of all i think it s would be a great benefit is, at same same time you can do other activity, and you can took it whenever you want, before or after work it all depend on what you think will be better for you. secondly if you have some family problem or you have to go somewhere immediately for a long time. that is an opportunity for you to learn or to not loss all the days you have been absent at the school. an other opportunity is if you go to college and you have a job at same time, if your classes are in the morning fron am to pm, and you job schedule is at pm to pm . at that time you have this big opportynity to sturdy and learning online, before work and you have some time left to do your homework, or other thing that you have to or you want to do in that day. it s not noly online you take the class online but, you will have a viedo conferencing to motivate you, that if you not understand, that can explain it to you. the school give them a big opportunity to progress, to have a good education and a better future. for me it is a great option for them to attend it.",3.5,2.5,3.0,3.0,3.5,3.5,2.898038864135742,2.823063373565674,2.86328125,2.8788983821868896,2.7282040119171143,2.8464860916137695
setting a good example by your own behavior is the best way to influence other people. people can see that you are being a good person and setting a good example. they can see you are being good and that they will get influence by it and would want to be a better good person. people that are not behaving good can see that you are being good and they would want to change to become a better person instead of setting a bad example. i think people that set bad example s should change to become a better influencing person instead of showing a bad example there will be alot of good people in this world if everyone showed a good example so everyone can see that being a good person is better than being a bad person. like in school you can show that you are doing your homework getting good grade. s showing good example s to other s and they would want to be the same like you so they can do good in school just like you get good grades pass the grade and do homework to not fail. showing a good example to better to show it with the way you behave.,2.5,3.0,2.5,2.5,3.5,3.5,3.159541368484497,2.926880121231079,2.9305708408355713,3.1629936695098877,2.863205671310425,2.9455747604370117
"based on my experiences i would say that is not true because people always can change. im my opinion i think people say that because with the person that they are talking to or they are meeting does not show interest on them. the first impression is not the best sometimes, but that it does not mean that it can not be changed. you can not classify or judge a person for their first impression because that person can change. one reason why you do not have to say that first impression is almost impossible to change is because if the person that you are meeting is not having a good day that can affect the first impression because he/she is not going to be comfortable talking or having a conversation in that moment. if i would have to give an example it would be the history of me and my best friend. the first time when i met him was in my math class, he did not even wanted talk to me and be my partner, when i asked him about problems that i did not understand he ignored me and he did not answer. to conclude if i would have to to take a position on this issue i would disagree, the reason why i would disagree is because in my circle of friends there is of them that they did not give me a good impression and if you look at us today we are good friend and that is why you do not have to say that the first impression is literally impossible to change.",2.5,2.5,3.0,3.0,2.5,2.5,3.647636651992798,3.564718008041382,3.5435941219329834,3.729781150817871,3.57226300239563,3.592050790786743

"having good attitude can be helpful by, helping others when they have a hard time in something, and when you and i are going through tough times, you can also have a good attitue a good minset on what your doing. a way of having a good attitude is by seeing things n the bright side of things, even though it s bad. another reason why having a good attitude is important, is because people appreciate when someone gives them a good feeling either their sad or mad. another reason why its important to have a good attitude is becasue you get things done properly, for an example, when you have to do a project due in two days you take your time and don t rush, you do things with a good attitude. if not your project will be at the end a mess, and you re going to be frusterated. having a good atitude is impotant because, you can help other when they re going trough tough times, for an example, whn my mom was sick and she was dealing with asma, we had to take her to the er mant times. it was sad for me to see her all sick, not only that but she was pregnat and could nrt anything because she had acid reflux. so whenever she felt sad and stressed out, i knew i had to support her and have a good attitude. by having a good attitude i had to help her with some house hold things because she could nt really do anything. another reason of having a good attitude is by also having a good mindset, because when you have a good minset you can go through your tough times easly. and when you are stresse out abput something you have to have a good minset and a good attitude. for an example when i had to deal with by spine problembecause my disk was moved,i had to hae a good attitude because if i am ther complaining about my pain, it s not going to help me. so if i just relax and take rest and tak my medications then i will have a good attitude, because i know that everything will be okay. so this is why having a good attitude is very helpful, because you can help others when they are going through tough times, or whenever you and i are going through tough times, and how it helps you succed in things.",3.0,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.0,3.210517644882202,3.042332887649536,2.9765841960906982,3.206979513168335,3.0582315921783447,2.9277548789978027
"although some say extracurricular activities are to enrich educational experiences many say otherwise. students should definitely be involved in after school activities, whether if it s a sport or club, students will enjoy their time. extracurricular activities could help a student get into collage. the student should be allowed to be apart of as many after school activities as they choose, they should first discusses with their families. the schools should not have the decision if students are in a activity or not based of if they will have time to do homework or study they should let the student make the decision and here s why. the students should be allowed to be in as many activities as possible, while managing their time. the student will have to add the activity to their schedule, and know they will now be doing this on a daily basses or if not multiple times a week. the students family will be able to help the student out when in need of it. there will be time for homework and studying, because with a well put together schedule the student will go to school their choice of activity and go home and do their work. the student and their family should be in control of the management of school work and activities the school shouldnt be involved. when you know something works for you do not let anyone get in between what works for and what doesnt work. students will have many opportunities in high school the extracurricular activities will just bring more and this is how. opportunities come and go in high school, but when a student is in a after school activity they will lots of opportunities. collage could be one of those opportunities, collages like to see a student that is or was apart of a club or sport team. athletes can get full ride scholarships to collage, when they can manage to do their school work and the activities it could help them in the future. a student managing their time can be difficult but with a well put together schedule can help them get to where they want to be. this is why schools shouldnt control student involvement in extracurricular activities but many have their opinions against this one. other say that the schools should have control over students and what activities the can do and however many they can do. the school wants the student to be able to have time to study and do homework but by doing that they will take away from the extracurricular activities students are in or want to be in. they say the school should have the power to be able to do this, the student and their families will not really have a say in the final decision. they say the school knows what is right for the student in making the decision on if they should be apart of a after school activity. the school wants the students to be able to do school work outside of school so they will",2.5,2.5,3.0,2.5,2.5,2.5,3.75702166557312,3.7865355014801025,3.7977285385131836,3.8817241191864014,3.734590530395508,3.7475600242614746
"i would think that some student s would stay home so they can catch up on things they need but some stay so they can get the help they really need. for example if a parent see s his child struggling they could ask their child and be like do you need help or what do you want us to do to help you. i m pretty sure that some students are gonna take this opportunity, and take online classes or get the help they need from a teacher or someone they know who can help them. the real reason that i think they will do it is because they would want to graduate from school so they can get the diploma and be happy that they did it with the help of a parent. yes, i do believe that student s would benefit with taking classes at home or by online classes with a video conferencing. student s should be grateful that some school s are giving them the opportunity to take some classes at home or even with a teacher they can video chat with and they can help them too. if it wasn t for the school who was giving us the privilege do take this opportunity for the help then we wouldn t be passing anything or getting the help we need. for example, if a student goes to the school and tell s them hey i m having trouble getting this subject i know for sure the teacher are gonna give them a choice to pick if they want help or take online classes at home with like a teacher who s helping them. another reason kids ask for help is because they probably ask at home and sometimes s parent s dont have the time to help them cause they are tired from work or they just tell them to ask someone else and then they don t get the help they need. for some student s it s easy for them but for some it isn t easy so some students can help each other so they can understand it. for other reason s it s better for kids to try on there own first and then if they still dont get it then they ask for the help or ask the teacher for help at the same time. in conclusion i think it s a good idea that the school can give the benefit for student s to take online classes so they can get the help they need.",3.5,3.0,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.0,3.6086931228637695,3.4239284992218018,3.3756017684936523,3.541921854019165,3.417958974838257,3.3901848793029785
"the author who wrote this line was very smart based in the life actuality the people when say, "" you will never grow"" i m agree with the author i think in this world some people not are conform with the that have. however the problem is that some people are avaricious, think that are better that others people and want all at the same time. the first reason is that some people are avaricious, is a bad influence for the people that want grown in the jobs, school and in the milieu family, for example my brother not finish the school, because he like the money and he think the best solution will be leak of the school for work more and have more money. and now he say that is not good idea leave the school for money. so they s think that are better that other people, for the society cause indifference to the other people, rejection would be also bulling. i am disagree with the thought of this type of people for example, if she/he can make something grand also the other people can the major greatness is the humility. the third reason is want all at the same time, when the author talk about ""you will never grow."" is because the knowledge of the life is not obtain things materials amount, because in this life all is vanity if you want grow start for conform with the little that you have for example, the education help for that you will be a good person with principles. the conclusion is that the life have many opportunities bad you have the option take one opportunity. for that you can grow and can be a good person, and be intelligent because the vanity is bad adviser.",2.5,2.0,2.5,2.5,2.0,3.0,2.4192988872528076,2.3732645511627197,2.356455087661743,2.4811887741088867,2.3908698558807373,2.3868212699890137

"i don t think it would benefit students to attend classes from home by online such as video conference why? because they would get distracted by anything else at home and also they wouldn t have the chance to experience what it would be like in school. if they attend school from home how would they get things done at home? they have the chance to do something else other then school work because they are going on their time. they also are not supervised with teacher like they would at school. they could easily get answers when it comes to tests and quizzes so where would the challenge be when you could just do that. when you are at school you are supervised so there is no looking up answer,you actually have to study to accomplish things. you could easily get distracted by things at home even say i dont want to do it anymore and i feel like thats the risk it would take if students are allowed to take classes at home online. students also would miss the chance to experience what it would be like in school. the chance to meet new people, make friends,and just simple socialize with other peers. it would also help students for the real world because when you work you can t do it from home on a computer. you actually have to show up to work and work with others. you also miss the chance to do other things that you would in school that you can t at home like join a club or play a sport and actually do so much that you can t at home. have that motivation to wake up and go to school and challenge your self and prepare yourself for the world. when you are at home,wouldn t you get board being home all day instead of being at school and just enjoying it. yes it s a struggle waking up early in the morning to go to school but also it s boring staying home and missing all the things you can do and learn at school with friends and teachers. i understand why some students would consider taking classes from home maybe they have a personally reason or they can t keep up and rather take their time at home but for that reason you would have to do your best and not get distracted. being home may help them do better then at school i understand but i think you miss a lot and all the experience that you could get at school. i personally don t think it would benefit missing all that and knowing how it would be. when you get a job that you dont have the option to do it home in the computer so how would you learn and know what it s like. therefor i don t think students would benefit from attending classes at home by online or video conferencing. student should attend school and experience it all not be home distracted and miss many",4.0,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.6823318004608154,3.6002395153045654,3.6186249256134033,3.7922298908233643,3.4997363090515137,3.608701229095459
if i could go any where in the world i would go to france. the reason i would go to france is because a lot of people said that france was a romantic and beautiful place to go. and the food there is amazing in france they also have a really good accent. but the main reason i want to go to france is because of the thing to see their stuff like the ifle tower. the other reason is to meet other people so in that case i would have to travel on a day theres going to be a lot of people. the reason i would go to france is to have the knowledge to be able to tell someone about how it changes you and how it s like and different temperature like how the country is to going to change on bad temperature their might just a small amount of people outside. on a good day there is going to a people are walking around having fun. you also try to see if the people their nice or mean to other people. if i ever had a choice to go to france i would say yes and when i get the first thing i would try is there food. because a lot of people said that the food in france is delicious so i thought what if i try to get my own opinion. to me it feels good to be apart of something it doesn t feel good to be the third wheel just staying back watching them give there feedback but have no clue what they er talking about. the animals in france are not that dangerous and the cats and dogs are exreamly cute. like chuwawas are so cute and the most known animals in france at lest that what i have seen on television. most people in france like animals and chuwawas design which makes them look better. i hope after reading this prompt you know more about france and it also persuade you to go visit france. france is also a beautiful place to visit with a wife or girlfriend to enjoy or relax with your loved ones. i hoped you liked my prompt and enjoy reading it.,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.5,3.5,2.5,3.048675537109375,2.908179521560669,2.8058226108551025,2.9772531986236572,2.8256871700286865,2.92378568649292

"having self reliance is a important key to success in life because self reliance is making your own efforts and decisions. i agree that people should make their own decisions because they should have freedom to make their own choices. they should think for them self. having the freedom to make their own choices is important because if they can have the freedom to choose what they want the experts are going to choose something that they dont like, or want. for example, the person wants to buy some fancy shoes but the authorities dont like those shoes they are going to say no and decide to buy other shoes. in my thinking i would not like to someone choose for me because they dont know what i like, or what i dont like. if they let other people make there choices they are not going to be happy because the expert or the authorities are going to choose what they like not what the people want. for example, they go to the lunch room and there is a lot of food there and they are trying to get something but they dont let them get what they want because they dont have the freedom to make there own choice, so the authorities are going to come and choose the food for them. another reason is that the person can think for them self. if the persons cant think for them self they are going to have a lot of problems in there life because if the expert, or the authorities comes and ask the persons something and they cant think, the experts are going to think for the persons and make choose something that the persons will not like. in conclusion, having the right, or the freedom to make the decisions for them self is a good think because everyone wants to make their own decisions they dont want no one to be telling them what to do, or what to think. the persons are going to have the freedom to choose what they want to do with there life.",4.5,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.5,3.5,3.2965924739837646,3.230820894241333,3.2158584594726562,3.2867488861083984,3.0995945930480957,3.218574285507202
"it is a most important thing to be yourself. at first pass, it would seem to be obvious that you would aspire to be yourself. but we all know of the pressures to please others as we grow up. first the pressure comes from your parents, then your young peers, on to teachers and bosses. you find yourself constantly trying to live up to the expectations of others and why not? it is usually a good things to follow the wishes of those who have raised you, and it is natural to conform to the ways of people who help you along the way. it is alot like osmosis. it is also expected that prescribed pathways are followed, in a way, to repay kindness and debts. as an example, parents pay for your education, including arts and sports activities so surely it makes sense that you would try to excel in those endeavours as a form of thank you. the same goes for showing a good teacher or mentor that you understand their lesson and often end up developing further on the path they revealed and recommended. however, at some point your own predictions and dreams emerge. let them and pay attention to them as they will become your guide to your ultimate destiny. while showing respect for your parents and elders, start to forge your own identity. those who truly love you will be on the sidelines cheering your every step. consider he words of dr. seuss, ""be who you are and say what you feel because those who mind don t matter and those who matter don t care . i couldn t have said it any better. essentially, and ultimately, you don t have any choice in the decision about being yourself. since the time of socrates, and no doubt before, a predominant human instinct has been to know thyself. the problem for some people however is that they harbour the inner self and keep it separate from the self they display to the world. this predicament can eventually morph into a personality disorder if the gap between your inner person and public persona is too wide. soon being in public will become a chore you will feel like a phony. you will probably end up living the life of the recluse. not a good result for most people except the odd monk. the best way to allow your inner self, that part of you that holds your real aspirations and dreams, to become what the world sees is to start cultivating the key aspects of those chracter traits. start becoming that person in your mind and begin to feel this is yourtrue self soon actions will follow. you will begin to feel comfortable in your own skin. for example, if you want to become a musician then slowly tell people that you ""are planning a career in music"" and start acting that way. surprisingly, this will start you help you as other people will begin to look at you in that light. eventually they will tell others who",3.5,3.5,4.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.8372256755828857,4.3262939453125,4.300784587860107,4.112341403961182,4.303932189941406,4.296077728271484

"imagine an old proverb said honestly was the best policy. what would you if some one used honesty in a bad was would you disagree or agree? i would agree because some acts of honesty can really mean a lot to someone. an old proverb says honesty is the best policy because it is the key of telling the truth and it can also create new friend ships in life. i would agree that honesty is the best policy, but if you miss treat honesty it can be very lethal to your trust with people. to lose someone s honesty is very hard i have seen car crash which someone got severely hurt and the person who crash into him won the court battle because he was not showing honesty. my father has told me honesty is a great part in peoples life. my father has told me stories were his friends have seen people get robed and their honesty has helped find who did it and convict the criminal. even just a little bit of honesty can help anyone. but when you use honesty you should never use it in a way that might hurt someone s feelings. i once was playing a game and the opposing team was not being very honest which hurt some of the kids feeling s on my team. but a persons honesty can always change at all times. i once had a friend who was never honest but changed through out his life and started to realize why honest is so important. i even have made new friend ships in life just from being honest. as we can see you might be able to get something from being honest. if you are always honest people respect you. i have been in instances ware honesty has created respect for me. when you show some form of honesty it creates a good environment around you which can make good relationship you. but when people use honesty to hurt your feelings by not being honest it makes you feel like you just have been hit by a train or it feels like you have been betrayed. once i was walking down my street and saw that there was lots of police cars out side one my neighbors houses. i heard that she got robed a couple months ago and found a witness that saw who the thief was because the witness was honest with the police it helped find who did the crime. as i can see honesty is the best policy. in conclusion, no matter the incident that happened you always should be honest. even in the future your actions can be justified from your honesty. honesty is the best policy because it impacts you to do the right thing and creates a good environment. when being honest it shows that you have a high self steam which is can be very good for you in the long run.",3.0,3.0,3.5,4.0,3.5,3.5,3.607166051864624,3.8094303607940674,3.769993543624878,3.5704309940338135,3.7749574184417725,3.826446771621704

"should people make their own decisions, or should they seek guidance from experts and authorities about life s important matter? one of the common questions i get ask. many people have different thoughts about this questions, my opinion is depending the sittuation. for example people can learn from there dicision but in other hand listening to people s advice can stop you from doing wrong. ever since i was little i always wanted to make my own decision and wont have to listen to no one but i the more i got older i realized that sometimes what people say to do can turn out to be better then the decision you took. making your own decision can make you more independent and know how life works and those are the people we look up too. depending on the situation your in listening to others give us life lesson can be one of the most unforgetables momments because that show you they care and want the best for you because maybe they didnt end up making the right decision and want you to prevent from doing it .",2.0,3.0,2.5,3.0,2.5,2.0,2.9001269340515137,2.8115460872650146,2.749619960784912,2.8409764766693115,2.7739152908325195,2.8443446159362793

"examples are what makes a readers/audiences be able to get attracted with what the reason the writer is talking about. since i have used examples in many things things in my life, i personally think that they could help you with a topic that other people are trying to talking about. and since the question is basically asking if ""examples are good to influences people that are trying to do something or does examples are useless and are not really helpful at all?"" i said that examples are good to influence other people. and here are the reasons why it is a good influential if you are striving for a long- term goal. not many reasons are able to support what you are trying to basically explain or prove. what made me think of this is because if you put a reason that isn t strong enough to even support what you are saying, then basically a reason isn t strong enough if you are trying to influence someone. like for example, if the topic says that anyone can become famous and the reason is ""work hard and never give up."" that really isn t strong enough to influences someone that actually wants to become that type of guy. but if you put a real life example like ""this person name generic_name that was a low-class, lives in a bedroom apartment, and makes not a lot of money. and he heard that he can become a rich person. so he was working hard and he saved up on investment. and somehow he actually became the person that he wanted to be."" that is a example that could be used if you are trying to persuade someone. examples can be kept as like a precious thing for people. why this is also important is because if you actually lets say achieve something that you wanted to accomplish for such a long time. you can always remember that thing that made you kept pushing forward, and to never let down what you wanted to do for such a long time. like for example, a person named generic_name made his dream become a reality; which it was to become a architect that works under a famous person. and when he had to make a speech, he remembered a women who was going through exactly the same thing he was going through. and he said that her life will be something he is going to cherish forever because her background is what made him become who he is now. which everyone can look at for being influenced by this person right here. examples can actually change many peoples lives because of what they say or just their background. what made me choose this reason? well it was because for the past years of my life, i have always seen many people change their lifestyle because of what people are saying to change them. like for example, when i was in th grade, i had a science teacher that was really nice to everyone and respected them",3.5,3.5,4.0,3.5,4.0,3.5,3.776461601257324,3.9409587383270264,3.9644269943237305,3.8246467113494873,3.88500714302063,3.8455252647399902
"most of the times, the students don t get the help they need by the school. the reason for this is because some teachers don t really care about whether the students are learning or not, but about their money. also, some students get bullied by other students and there is no one who could defend them. this happens in a many schools, such as schools in mexico, united states, central america, etc. so, in my opinion, attending classes at home is a great option for the students. classes online, well known as ""homeschooling"", is a method in which students can do the assignment of their classes at home in their computer. this idea emerged because there is many conflicts that school has to deal with, for example discrimination, and violence and between the students. so, thanks to the advances of technology, the school can provide their services at home. is a great method, but not as going to the school, sit in your chair and learn. this method has its advantages, but also its disadvantages. one of the advantages attending classes online is that is more comfortable and secure for the students. for example, the rate for shooting will be reduced, and the students will not suffer any discrimination against other students. another reason are that it is less stressful because the students would more time to complete any work. also, it helps the students to better subject. for example, students can watch videos about any specific subject, observe the procedures, and replay them if they are confused. also parents can supervise their children and help them if they need, and they would not have to worry about attendances. classes online are a great benefit for students but they their disadvantages as well. for example there will be no jobs for teachers who really want to teach, share experiences to their students, and help them to improve in their lives. another example is that students would not communicate with other students and would not know the importance of team work. also, they would not have an experience by doing activities (such as playing sports, instruments, going to filmstrips, etc,) which help them to develop useful skills. another disadvantage is that schools would not have alternate classes that helps them to chose the career they want to. for example construction, cosmetics, arts, music, engineering, technology, etc. in conclusion, attending classes online is a great method, but not as much as going to the school. the school is always going to be a learning center. if the school applies more fair rules, the students would feel more safety and gain a lot of confidence. also, the school has to have better teachers who really want to help their students and not teachers that only care about their job. anyways, the school helps us to get right path for our lives, so without it, we would not the education we need to improve in our lives and in the world.",3.0,3.5,4.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.7509305477142334,3.9686145782470703,3.879181146621704,3.7668185234069824,3.8370234966278076,3.9933087825775146
"from my personal experience back in middle school, i had to use technology for many different reasons. one of the reasons were for research purposes. i was able to use technology as a tool to provide information on my assignments and projects. so far technology has made a positive effect in my life not only in school but in real life. technology has helped me accomplish and complete many difficult task in life. i believe that technology has made a positive effect on people s lives; consequently, it makes peoples lives a lot easier and convenient. one reason that technology has a positive effect on people is that they are able to study without having to go out on a library and pay for books or a tutor to teach them. for example, people who are disabled or unable to travel out of their houses are able to go online and research for books and look for a site to teach them what they need to learn. the availability to go online and research for information also helps students who are too busy to go outside and ask others for help. many schools started providing laptops and ipad s to students who are unable to connect online. schools are using these electronics because they provide an easier way to help student learn and complete work. technology can also help people do many other things online other than researching for information. furthermore, technology may also be used as a way to shop whatever and whenever. for example, ebay and amazon is an online shopping website for many things such as: furniture, clothes, food, and many other reliable things. this has made it a lot easier for people to purchase items that they want at any time. online shopping helps a lot of people who are looking for items that cannot be found in local stores. for example, many custom equipment s and items can only be found online and in places that may not even be located in your place. not only does technology may be use as an online tool, it may also used as a way to communicate to others in the world. lastly, communication has been a major part of the world; in addition, technology has been one of their ways to communicate. for example, our military has improved a lot throughout the years due to the inventions of many technologies. technologies such as: cellular devices, radar, satellite and many other communicating tools has helped us win wars and accomplish many things around the world. another reason why technology has had a positive effect on people is that they use it for emergency purposes. for example, if an adult needs to call out of work for the day because of family problems, he may use his cellular device to call and inform his supervisor about it. many people say that technology is a way to showcase yourself as a lazy person and i disagree with that. i believe that technology allowed many people to accomplish and complete many task. technology",4.5,4.5,5.0,4.5,5.0,5.0,3.871581792831421,4.52027702331543,4.511119365692139,4.1148295402526855,4.372838020324707,4.479156017303467
"this essay has been written to take in consideration the advantages and disavantages of a four-day school week with each day considering to be ten hours which for some people it might seems to be a better way to conserve energy and resources. as a student i can say that i agree with this ""benefit"" but in this case i don t agree with making school two hours longer than usual for some students spending eight hours in school is consider to be enough becuase people get exhausted by spending most of the day sitting in a classroom. for example: in every classroom there is someone who is always sleeping during class due to the a lot of work school leave us to do, people who has work after school, and even sports. these reasons of why people gets to be too tired to stay up during class, imagine having to spend two additional hours in school just to have a three day weekend which might seems good but it really doesn t. spending two hours more than usual for four days it just a way to still using energy even though people think they are saving energy but they really are not doing any better, let s use this as a example: the two hours we are using extra for the four day it still makes up for the eight hours we are losing for the fifth day of class. the extra two hours of monday-thursday sum to be eight hours that people still use the energy, which means they aren t really saving energy example number : my friend generic_name loves the idea to have a four day school because this means that he will have a extra day to do homework and to spend time with his girlfriend generic_name. for him this new programs works perfectly and is an advantage for him. example number : my boyfriend generic_name loves to study but he does not agree with this new idea because he has sports to do after school for like about hours of training for the basketball team in our school and then after that he works for hours to help his mom with his car insurance which means that he won t get enough to sleep at night because after he gets home from work he has to do homework so we won t have to turn in it late. like him there is a lot of more students in the same situation. who does thing sacrifies to help their parents to make the payments. however, teacher s opinion matter too and they will be tired of speaking ten straight hours too, remember that they aren t robots who are just set up by the government. this means that they might not even agree with this new idea of making school loger for students and teachers. my school should not follow this model because they should think in everybody s benefits including teachers and students plus the staff of every department in the school s main office to",3.5,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.269164562225342,3.070406913757324,3.098229169845581,3.274784564971924,3.033766031265259,3.0608296394348145

"i think we can t compare between businesses and school because these two themes are different in how they work. to fallow this model of conserve energy and resources we have to know the reason to adopt if this model can benefit or not the school , following this model the school can confront many problems also can have many benefits but there are many reasons why the school have to follow this model and why school don t have to follow, first, we will talk about the disadvantages, extending two hours to the school days will be weary for the students, students will gonna be tired in the classroom and that s not benefit the students, if having eight hours in a regular week students feel tired, so adding two hours to the class days will be disastrous to the students. students, teachers would be affect by this changes the reason why can be affect is because they will not have time to pass with their families or things that they need to do after school. many students from school works to help their families or because they are living alone and they need to work to provide their personal things, so they will not have time and that s will be a reason why they can left the school. students from the sports teams, club members will be affect because most of their activities are after school,so if the school adopt the new model that is adding two hours to the regular calender all they can be affected because of time. teachers also can be affect because they have personal life they need to grade the students work and in this new calender they can t do all. people who works in schools will be affected because they will have one day off of their regular week. parents and students will not feel comfortable they can be disagree with this change and this can cause conflict with the school principle and this can bring many other conflicts follow this model can bring many changes where the students can be benefits by this change of the new calender, also teacher people who works in school can be benefit. one reason can be the four days of school that means the students will have three days off. students can have more time to do the homework because most students work during the weekend and they don t have time to do the homework so they will have an extra day to do all the things that they need to do. students can learn more and this can be a reason to change the calender, adding two hours to the schedule will help the students because they will have more time to learn. also teachers can be benefit because also they have to evaluate the students and they have just the weekend to do that and that is short time , so they will have one day to grade and do all that they need to do. all the the people are benefit",3.0,3.5,3.5,2.5,3.0,3.0,3.50687313079834,3.1364729404449463,3.1756370067596436,3.3694369792938232,3.1316380500793457,3.1882402896881104

"positive attitude is the key to be successful in life. most of the time older people or somebody you don t really know they will tell you to give all your effort and think smart. by having a positive attitude people feel more happy and comfortable. for example,when they have a positive attitude people stars to give you some advises from the experiences they have been through. in life to have a positive attitude we have to know how to deal with our problems even tho sometimes we might think we can not do it but, there is always a solution and after all that has happened we learn how to have a smart thinking and not giving up. having a positive attitude makes people have a good communication with others. when having a conversation with another person you can learn more about anything. sometimes the people who has good skills or positive attitude in their jobs or any other occupations they have the opportunity to earn a higher position in their job. for example,all managers have that position because they have showed that they can have a good attitude with themselves and other people. this gives them the chance to be a successful person in life and help to become as them. education is also a big influence and how a person can have a good attitude and good values. life teaches people how to control their emotions and help those who need it. in life to become successful people needs to have a goal and a plan how they are going to accomplish that. i know sometimes we have many problems and we think it not possible to have a good attitude but, there is a way how to deal with bad attitude and always have in mind the goal we want to accomplish one day. there is always people who is going to say negative things to others instead of give them advises. also many people think they can not do it after they try the first time and did not happened how they expected. people has to keep in mind that not always everything will be easy to get and there will be obstacles in life that will make you feel that you can not get what you want. by thinking and having a positive attitude people can make it become true just don not give until you have reached your goal. in conclusion,in my opinion having a positive attitude can make people become successful in life. be some educated persons and listen to what others say to them. many older people or family might not want to see you fail and that is the reason for those who keep a positive attitude so they will be proud of those who protrude in life. giving up would never be option for those who really have the desire to accomplish what they want. it is not going to be easy to always have a positive mind but,if the person really wants that then it will give all it s",3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.8605551719665527,3.824537754058838,3.932314395904541,3.9869344234466553,3.8432655334472656,3.8909151554107666

"i think curfews do keep teenagers out of trouble and it helps them sleep on time because after those hours a lot of law breaker are on the streets and something bad could be happening outside or on the streets like gang fights , shootings , robbers , durg dealers, drunk drivers and many more. the first reason is shootings mostly happens at night late after p. m and it would be better to stay inside in those hours than to go outside and for example a teenager is walking home from a friends house late in the midnight and gets in a fight with gang member and gets shot. while it would have been better with the curfew in place. curfews help teenagers go to sleep on time well like on the weekdays when they got school the next day and sleep on time and wake up on time and be refreshed for a test or something for example a teenager has school the next day and since he does not have a curfew he sleeps late and he misses the bus and forgets he has a test that day. and another example a teenager has a game he does not sleep early and he wakes up tried and is not able to play the game as well as he could. curfews could also help teenagers mange their time appropritely and how they spend the day for example a teenagers has a project or a home work the curfew time will help know what he/she must do first before he/she have some free time and goes to sleep. in conclusion adopting the curfew idea would be good because it will keep the teenagers out of trouble and help them mange their time appropritely.",3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.5935423374176025,3.3293139934539795,3.397392511367798,3.5800819396972656,3.4831717014312744,3.471381902694702

"do curfews keep teenagers from getting into trouble? the city council is still currently debating on either adopting the curfew to be at p. m. during the week days or at midnight on the weekends. if teenagers were to be out after the hours selected, it would be considered breaking the law. the laws are choosen for many reasons, even if we don t agree with most of them; we have to obey the laws. i believe the city council should adopt the cerfew for the minnors. when it comes to under age people in this world we have to be more conserned for their safety, it is best to have curfews. we should consider all the dangerous things going on in this world. have you considered all the things that could happen when your child is out? there is many dangerous things going on in this world. i m not saying something will happen but honestly nowadays anything could happen. without an adults care vision many things could occur. many minnors are being killed or harmed for reasons we don t know. a curfew is one way from preventing those things from happening to your children. even though a curfew at midnight on a weekend could still be dangerous; it is our responsability to teach the minnors from right to wrong. if we get them to understand why it is important to have a curfew they would be exrta careful. theres a high possability they won t want to listen about their curfew; i can speak for myself i would want to spend more time with my friends there was a few times i didn t listen to my mom. i relized how much my safety ment to my mother and how worried she would be when i would be out late. have you heard about what happened to generic_name in new york? he was such a good child. his mother talk about how he loved hanging out with his nephews and family. she said he wouldn t go out with friends, he would always be home. he was very close to his sister, they d always be together. generic_name had good grades in school, he would never get into trouble at all. the reason i bring his story life into this essay is because he was killed a few blocks away from is house, outside a little food market. i m not so sure about the time but it was after dark. it was a group of guys who saw him, dragged him out the market and stabbed him under his arm. he tryed asking for help but no one would help him; he tryed getting to a hospital by foot unfortunaly generic_name didn t make it and died on the sidewalk. those guy were caught a few months later and said they confused him with another guy. generic_name had no fault in any of it,he didn t deserve it. maybe if he would of wanted for the next day or if his mom would of took him things could",3.5,3.5,3.5,4.0,4.0,3.5,3.7840261459350586,3.659334897994995,3.7276883125305176,4.087578296661377,3.6751773357391357,3.654207706451416
"the most persuasive, efficient way to influence others takes someone to set a good example of their behavior. those examples sets an image in people s minds of how they want to see themselves in an ideal state. moreover, every single human being on this earth has a certain vibe or energy they give off due to their actions and thinking that people perceive or take in to judge that person. when people see that someone else has an energy or vibe he/she likes or agrees with, he/she will tend to gravitate towards it. setting a good example is the best way to influence others because people want to know what is morally right or wrong, to see change and improvement, and to take on similar motives. the first reason why setting a good example is the best way to influence others is people want to know what is morally right or wrong. martin luther king jr. is demonstrated as a great example of influencing others about what is right and wrong by leading a protest that many african americans were involved in. martin luther king jr. gave a famous speech called "" i have a dream "" which radiated strong energy that gave african americans the strength and pride to protest the whites racist segregation laws. the great example set by martin luther king jr. displayed that he was a capable and high-thinking individual that african americans gravitated towards. due to the fact that african americans were influenced by martin luther king jr., they were able to understand what their rights as a human being were and how wrong the whites segregation laws was. the second reason why setting a good example is the best way to influence others is people want to see change and improvement within themselves. a personal trainer could be a figure for some people as they are persistent and passionate at what they do. this can lead people to being motivated at the gym and encouraged to become more fit and healthy. also, it sets a postitive message in their mind saying they have what it takes to get to the point of where their personal trainer is. having the personal trainer as a figure to gain motivation from led to a person seeing improvement and change in their body and mindset. the final reason why setting a good example is the best way to influence others is people desire to take on similar motives. at an early stage of development as a child, they tend to look up to their parents or popular figures in awe as they gain inspiration to become a certain profession. a child may have seen an astronaut on television and became inspired to become one when he/she grows up. this inspiration may have led this upcoming astronaut to take astronomy and other space-related classes. then an amateur astronaut is born because the astronaut on tv decades ago set a good example on how interesting tasks an astronaut has to do which led to the inspiration. in conclusion, people better themselves",5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.5,3.857393741607666,4.460169792175293,4.406491756439209,4.099998474121094,4.287440776824951,4.532294273376465

i think is important because de churchill have a important place and the ministery british work in that. also is important because is recognized for many people. the ministery british is play for that important role. i think the people is interested for that. that help many people. sometimes the people helps to others and work together for had a good ministery and for help the government or the country and if that some people obtained any help for the education for the kids. also the mayor is a good person he received the support of his country and all the community has a good life.,1.5,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.337918519973755,2.226097345352173,2.258338212966919,2.363616466522217,2.2739694118499756,2.3672735691070557
"i agree with churchill statement about the important role that failure plays in the pursuit of succes, because the way to become to the success is not gonna be easy. all the people that try to have a good success they gonna have failure on the way and sometime they fall apart, but they never have to loss their enthusianm, because the succes consists in fall apart and wake up again, and keep going looking for a good success that gonna be graet for their life and their family gonna be haughty of them. i agree because, the life gonna put many impediment to have a good success we have to keep going do not have to loss aur enthusiasm, for example. my family came of a poor family, but i have an ancle that he never loss his enthusiasm of has a good success, so he worked too hard for it. one failure that he has on his way to the succes was the poorness, but he keep going wrestlering for get uot of the poorness and help his father and mother, one day he found a job and begin to meke money and his first thing that he made was to buy a bed for him, then he to begin to save money to come to this country, now he has a lot money in his bank account because he put his own company of landscaping, but he never loss his enthusiasm about his success. i agree with this statement, because there is a lot example of how the people have many failure and they keep going never loss their enthusiasm of their success, one of this example is of one soccer player his name is cristiano ronaldo. he is a famous soccer player, but to have a great success he had many failure one of thase failure was that his father died when hi was a kid it was hard for him even has to see a psychologist and he to overcome that, he keep going looking for his success, but he failure again because the people and couche s that saw him, don t believe him they say like he doesn t has future, but he keep work in his success and show to all the people that don t believe him that they was wrong. because he has a future and he gonna has a great success, now he is the best soccer player in the world for many people, but he always worked so hard to get out of the failure and he to obtain a good success. i agree with mister churchill, because the way for a great success is gonna be long and we gonna have many filure to obtain this, for example. i am trying to graduate from high school, but one of failure was that it is not been easy for me, because this is a new language for me and it is dificult to talk, but i keeping going trying to get my diploma , another failure is that i have",3.0,2.5,2.5,2.0,2.5,2.5,2.5998408794403076,2.4505929946899414,2.424861192703247,2.6373276710510254,2.4194254875183105,2.4777441024780273

"in my opinion students should come to school. some schools offer distance learning as an option for students,which allows the students to be irresponsibles and not to show their work to the teacher. as we can see taking classes online is not a good option to us, for instance if we dont make the time to attend the classes online, or by the time we are taking the online classes we received a text for friend we stop doing what we are doing and got distracted by the electronic devices and, others words if we come to school received classes we are going to be able to get the knowledge that we need to be great in our academic life. i consider myself that taking online classes is not a good option for students. some students that take online classes are procrastinators,they dont care about their homework, or they wait until the last minute to do it. the truth is, if we dont take our online classes seriously how we are going to learn. for example, my friend generic_name is taking online classes and she said that taking online classes allow her to be irresponsible by not doing her homework. some students dont make the time to take the online classes and we just forget to take it. i wonder how we are going to learn if we dont make the time to do it. sometimes we got distracted for something that have nothing to with the class that we are taking. however, if we have a job and we got home late, and in our mind is to get home and take the online classes, but when we get home we are so tired and we just want to go to bed, and forget about what we have to do. the last and more important reason what we should take classes in school is, if we attend to school,we can ask questions to the teacher and he can provides us with a powerful answers and specific examples, if we attend to school that will helps us to get a responsibility to be every day at school and not to miss any important class, and also that would gives the knowledge that we would need to be great in life. in final consideration i think students should come to school and take our classes, that way we would learn more better than taking it in online, and also that we will makes us more responsible. as we take the classes in school we will get the knowledge that we would need to success in our academic life in general we would be great in our professional life.",2.5,2.5,3.0,2.5,2.5,2.5,3.5466156005859375,3.3492355346679688,3.3454527854919434,3.4540154933929443,3.363682270050049,3.4019248485565186

"they say the you should never judge a book by its cover and, especially regarding people, its true. in this case, the cover is not necessary meaning the appearance, but the first impression of another person. like the cover of a book, first impressions are not always as appealing as what is really there. its not until after you start ""reading"" or get to know someone, when you really find out that what you see is not always what you get. there are several factors that can affect the first impression that one receives from another. differing personality, situations and representation of a person, make impressions often the worst means of judging people. a person s personality has a big effect on the first impressions that they emit. everybody is different but when it comes down to it first impressions are really based off of whether you are shy or not. i met my best friend after moving during my junior year, at my new high school. before i knew her, she never said a word to me or anyone else in the classes that she was kind of odd, but then realized that i was the same way, i didn t talk to many people either because of my personality. i knew that i was shy person and after i get to know someone, i put down my front and show my true colors. i thought that maybe she would be same way. after starting to talk to her a little more each day, our friendship grew and i learned that she wasn t odd at all, but just like me an outgoing person hidden by their shyness. some people like me and my friend, are shy and put up a reserved and quiet front when facing new people. based on my first impressions of my friend, i thought something that was far from the truth. one who has a shy personality might in reality be outgoing, but uncomfortable showing it at first, making the first impression of that person a mistaken one. your first impression of someone is not suitable because you do not know the situation they may be in. when seeing or meeting someone new, you have no idea the kind of day, difficulties or kind of disappointment that person may be experiencing. they may have have recently lost someone, or could be someone new and yet still have to deal with the routines and stresses going through out their day. all of these situations can create a barrier between themselves and others, and setting of a good impression is probably not at the top of their list of important things to do. on my first day of senior year, i walked hurriedly to my first class, even thought i had plenty of time to get there. when i walked into my class, the only thing on my mind was to find a seat right away, no matter if it was by another person or not. when the time come to eat lunch, i sat by myself and",4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.5,3.5,3.8864264488220215,4.1514482498168945,4.310436248779297,4.098914623260498,4.177324295043945,4.2242960929870605

"students should participate in extracurricular activities i believe students should participate in extracurricular activities because one it keep them out of trouble, two some of the activities keep them healthy, and three they are fun. one reason students should participate in extracurricular activities is because they keep most students out of trouble. for example, it can keep the students occupied so they don t have to be on the streets. another example is sometimes these activities can help them relax and keep them calm so they stay out of trouble. another reason is some of the activities can keep them healthy. for example students can do football or basketball which keeps them running and keeps them in good shape. they can also do lift training after school which keep them fit and all around healthy. last but not least these activities are fun. there are always a lot of activities and you can always find something you like. for example if you like sports there are so many different sports you can do. there are also other things like drama club if you like acting, art club if you like drawing, even robotics club if you like technology and stuff like that. therefore these are the reasons i agree that all students should do at least one extracurricular activity.",3.5,4.0,3.0,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.453423500061035,3.4793756008148193,3.4926393032073975,3.441044807434082,3.5186686515808105,3.5297446250915527

"technology allows people to complete many tasks, without having contact with others. people can check out books, shop, and play games without speaking to another person has limitation on humans contact due to the use of technology had positive or negative effects on people s lives. i believe that technology had positive effects on people s lives because we can talk with people in long distance, working online without driving,and find new friends. the first reason is that technology had positive effects on people s lives is because we can talk with our family that are not with us. also when we missed them we can video call each other, and know about each others life. for example if there was no technology we can t talk with our families that are in long distance. and we don t know about each other, and maybe we will forget each others by the time past. that s why technology is the best thing that we have in our lives. everyone should have technology because it s important for them and maybe something happen to you like accident and your family can find you by using their technology and find where the accident is happen. furthermore you can use technology when you are sick and you can t go to your work you can call your boss to tell him/her that you can t come today, if there was no technology it wasn t possible to do these things. second reason is that technology had positive effects on people s lives because people can work online without driving and vesting their time. initially when you working online you can save your money and can do all of your work in your house. however that s good because if you have a children and you want to be with her/him it can help you because you can do your work and be with your child. furthermore if you can t drive and you wish to work at home technology will help you to work online without driving long distance. furthermore technology is good thing when you want to travel you can travel and at the same time you can work by your technology, and you can make more money. third reason is that technology had positive effects on people s lives that we can find new friends ,culture and new languages. initially when you go to social media you can see different people with different culture and you want to know about their culture and their languages, so technology will help you to communicate with them and ask them question about their religion, country and etc. furthermore when you going to some other country that you don t know your way technology will helps you to find your way. for example when you going to the country that you love to know about that country more but you can t ask question because you don t know the people, and their language in there, also you lost yourself in there you can t talk or",3.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,2.5,2.0,3.3230228424072266,3.118959903717041,3.0973880290985107,3.2235519886016846,3.0566275119781494,3.0846805572509766

"sometimes is really hard to get this opportunities. if students get the chance to learn about what they like they should take advantage of it. they might learn things that interested them. although some students think this opportunities are useless, actually it opens a lot of doors at a young age to learn about the things they like. for some students this is a big privilege. find out who they are. a few of this students are not really insterested in this opportunities. they tend to think that is useless just because they don t have the program they are insterested in. normally people get use to the things they like, and they don t want to learn new things. sometimes is hard to see that learning about new things could give huge benefits. other students realize that it could be fun to learn about new things. if they are lucky enough they could find the career they like. when kids start to go to school teachers always ask them to think about what they want to be when they grow up. almost everyone wants to be a policeman, a fireman, a teacher, or a doctor. when they grow up their way of thinking chances. kids realize that there are a lot of other things that they could like. while others grow with the same mentality. some of them make it happen, but some others change their mind in the way. it does not only happens when they are little. it could happen when they grow up, so they should give it a try to new things. it might be better than it looks. also, if they find the program they like and try it out they might find out if they truly like it. i had a friend, and he really loved psychology. he took the class this year because he thought it could be interesting. midway through the year he found out that he is not so good at it. although it was too late to back up he realized that psychology was not what he was looking for. sometimes people believe they have what they want and that there is nothing that could stop it. they all should have a second plan in case plan a is not working so well. everyone should be ready just incase there is a rush change, and they have to take a decision in less than a day. they have to hope the best and get ready for the worst. some students think this opportunity is lame for not having what they want to learn about. some others see that there are a lot of benefits in it and go for it. i classify myself as the kind of student that takes new chances. i also have two careers in mind. i know if one of them fails me i still have the other one. this is why i should get the opportunity to go. i truly want to know if the careers i have in mind are what i want to do",3.5,3.0,3.5,4.0,4.0,3.5,3.873939037322998,4.047523498535156,4.146146774291992,4.116252422332764,4.088868141174316,4.101617813110352
"if you master a subject you like and dont try pushing your limits you wont succeed. why wouldnt you want to push your limits? theirs a reason why people get stuck in life, when they master their subject. they get fustrated when they can t find jobs or good pay wage. i agree on what author ralph waldo emereson because if you dont have that motivation on what you master it can affect you. if you dont push yourself into doing more than beyond than life will not treat you as you wanted. i agree on author ralph because i ve experience things in life that if you dont try on something , than you wont be able to grow. if you look at bill gates he master on his program and what did he do he share his product and open stores. he grew just by mastering his program. my experience was mastering in learning how rebuild a engine from just the block to how to make more power. now im fixing peoples cars and doing tunes for their cars. i know these guys that called themself diesel brothers. they are master diesel technician. so what did they do? they bought a shop , got a crew and got sign to do a tv show. they work on diesel trucks, diesel cars and anything that is diesel. then they decided to do custom trucks and custom military cars. that wasn t enough for them, so they came up with ideas to use military axles and putting them on custom trucks making those trucks so heavy duty they can even pull a train! my father told me that you should never stop, even if you reach that goal. he said,"" you reach that goal make another goal, you can t stop at what your doing and if you do,than theirs going to be bumps in the road and than your going to make huge mistakes."" just from those words it s like million bucks to me. why because if you stop at what you master ,than somebody is going to master it better than you ever thought and your not going to grow from it. when they master their subject, those people get happy right but whats next? lets say you master your subject and than you find a job that pays good. the money looks good and you stay at that job for a couple of years. i d say that probably percent of you staying at that job will make your miserable. people get bored and can t find nothing else to do,but do the exact samething over again. it s going to make you want ot quit and find something else to do. then once you quit your job what s going to be in your mind? probably nothing at the moment,but then your realize that you master that subject and want to share it, make it to your own business and improve from it. so i do agree on what author ralph waldo emerson wrote. i believe that",3.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.2158381938934326,3.0450193881988525,3.0279674530029297,3.1648635864257812,3.0867459774017334,2.9387354850769043
"working in a group can be helpful. working alone is also good for you because you can focus and get the job done without being distracted. seeing people working in groups shows that really only people do the work and the rest play around. you also dont get the full learning experince working in a group than you get working alone. when you work in a group you dont know your strengths and weaknesses your just wondering what to do but when working alone, you can realize what you need help on and what you dont need help on. working in a group can make you lazy, because you depend on your group to do the work for you most of the time. personally i would rather work alone than work with a group. working alone gives you peace, quiet and space that will help you work at a fast pace. when you work alone you tend to ask your teacher qustions in order to help you and thats good. its also gives you the power to do what you thinks right. working in a group, you cant do what you think is right the whole group gets to decide the answer. working alone can also benifet you by your grade they show you how well you did on it or if you did bad. if you did bad then you can study and see what your missing out on and that can make you better and understand the topic correctly next time. my personal preference is working alone even though working in a group that could be a great experince i d rather work alone. it gives me motivation to get my work done faster then not caring. you can get distracted and carried away fast at this day and age. alot of students love to work alone its a great time to themselves and to finish their work. working alone saves you the trouble of getting blamed for something you shouldn t have been blamed for. so i think working alone is more benificial for everyone. unless you are assigned a project and its due very quickly then thats the perfect way to work in a group. but thats a whole different story. at the end of the day i will rather choose to work alone than in a group but some might think otherwise.",3.5,4.0,3.5,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.758099317550659,3.7733256816864014,3.7423830032348633,3.9107301235198975,3.6862454414367676,3.7931571006774902
"former british prime minister once said that ""success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm"". i disagree with this statement. in my own experiences i have never failed to succeed, i have always failed to fail. in - th grade i have tried out for my school basketball team and never made the team. i have also experienced doing something on my first try and succeeding, failure never brings success. all through out my life i wanted to play basketball for my school. the only problem was every year i tried out i never made the team. this year i am a senior in high school and still havent played basketball for my school. i have realized that no matter how good i got it wasnt enough. personally i can not relate with failing to succeed because it has not happened to me. i have never been able to fail and then succeed. i can say from my own experiences. somethings just come to you and your able to keep being good at it. while there are also things that are not able to do on the first try or ever. for instance my seventh grade year i was trying out for football. i had never played a game or ever tried out. first try and boom i am on the football team. i played left tackle and was a starter for ""a-team"". i had never played before and i was already starting. i didnt fail to succeed, i just succeeded. as a result from the facts i have stated. i do not believe or agree in ""failing comes success"". failing happens to everyone and i have yet to hear someone say "" i failed to succeed"". it is very uncommon for someone. if it has not happened to me in all of my seventeen soon to be eighteen years of life i dont believe it is possible.",3.0,3.5,3.0,4.0,3.5,4.0,3.6884000301361084,3.699712038040161,3.604938507080078,3.8686487674713135,3.702183485031128,3.6044094562530518

"given students a long summer opportunities would give them the chance to take a restful break from all the ethic school year they have being having. most students enjoy summer break vacation. but some educators feel that the summer is too long because students has a long summer vacation would take the time to review their school year and go to summer school for makeup class while others are planing to spend time with their families . though others are thinking that students should have a year round school where there would be a three to four weeks in the summer and a longer winter break but meanwhile a week off in spring and fall break because during snow days the students would have no school and they would get to go to school while it really cold outside. i think it not a great idea because most students thinks the long summer is a great opportunity for them to participate in some various positive activities and for them to sets a standard goal for themselves. most students should get a long summer break because they have to take their time and review their work and go to summer school for a make up class that would help them to get credits back or graduates the coming years. imagine have in a break during the summer, would any students have the chances of making up class work during the winter? or would they even think about the ideas of doing a class makeup?. i think no because they would be giving an excuse about the snowy weather and the real cold weather and schools would be canceling which would affects the process of curriculum on what the class are learning. for example during the winter when we sometimes gets a snowy weather we cancel schools and that one day that school get cancel it affects most teachers planing on what they should do for that day. for instance the school would have to take a week off of that summer break so that the teacher would have time to complete what he or she has to teach the students. therefor students needs a longer summer break to succeed on their goal. meanwhile other students need a long summer breaks to spend a long time with their families because they has already spend a long school learn especially the once that had honors class also the students who are in college. most students who spends some quality time with their family might have a better chance of setting up a goal for the next school year by all means because they are getting a better advice from their family, for example i had a understanding that students who spent the most time with their family discussing their school year would get motivated and has a goal for themselves before the new school year, meanwhile in the winter break, you wont have that much time to spend with your family, because most of your family who live far across would most likely not want",3.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.5,3.1204471588134766,2.7789649963378906,2.738860607147217,3.039748430252075,2.8103206157684326,2.848148822784424

"choose your own character the british naturalist and politician john lubbock wrote,""your character will be what you yourself choose to make it.""do we choose our own character traits, or is our character formed by influences beyond our control? take a position on this issue. do we need to choose are own character traits yes, or no? in my opinion i will say yes we need choose our character because if we choose our character we can be wherever we want, good,or bad person, etc and we are going to do a good job if we choose our own character traits. first, if i choose my own character i will give my best work because i choose my own character, and i m going to feel very comfortable, and so happy to do it my character. for example, i remember one friend from my country hi s name were generic_name and he was doing a activity school was theater, and they were doing the story of little red raiding hod, and he was acting the wolf he was the bad gay, and he did a really good job i was so impressed, i remember he say in the stories i always i m going to be the bad guy because the bad guy is the second most important character, and is the conflict of the story the one who make interesting the story. next, you can develop and demonstrate your skill acting, if you choose your own character because you are going to do a great work, and you are going act like you are a real actor and maybe you can discover acting, if have a passion of acting. for example, i hear some stories about actor. how they like acting, and they say in the first time they didn t liked to act but them there was starting like how they act, that how they like to acting because it s fun to act, and you can enjoying acting with your friends. finally, if i do one character i don t like, or i don t choose probably i m not going to give my best work because i m not going to feel comfortable or exacting to do it. for example, i remember like years ago in my english class we do a act about romeo and juliet and they give my the character of the guard and i was not exacting to do it, so i didn t do very well but i try i think if i try maybe i will like the character but i didn t liked that why i prefer to choose my own character. in conclusion, if you choose your own character you are going to do a good job and great work, you are going to demonstrate and develop your skill acting if you do the character you choose, and if you do a character you did choose you probable are not going to do a great job, or maybe you are not going care about the character this are the reason why",4.0,3.0,4.0,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.091196298599243,2.81477427482605,2.746471881866455,3.104586362838745,2.795217752456665,2.795417308807373
"in this prompt i agree and disagree, because in societies now in days some students do know for sure what career they want to study/become when older. some students don t know exactly what they want to study/ become when older. it all depends on the student, for example if the student is for sure on what they want to be when older. thats because either since they where little they have always like firefighters or a police officer. once growing up they notice they can become one too and follow there dream on being something they have always loved since they where young. also it could be that there mom or dad, or a family member that was or in the military or a firefighter. that want to follow those steps too, and make their family members proud. they also took interest on what their family member do or have done in life. now for the student who are not sure of what they exactly want to be once their older/ study. some students are actually not sure what they are interested in doing and need help finding what they would love to study about, or some students wants to explore and have options to see what they are most interested in doing for the future. students who dont know for sure what they want to be when older , needs help finding their interest because most of the time their shy on going into a class with new people they don t know. also in high school their are academy and sometimes the class you pick are not at the school you go to so a bus would take you to that school. and some students are scared to go to another school because they dont know that school so well. in other cases that i haven t really heard of as much as the other ones, that they are scared to study what they love because they dont want to be judged by other people or also because their parents wants them to study to become a doctor or a lawyer when really they want to be a police officer or something else that they are interested in. so its hard for them to become what they really want to be in the future. i would agree and disagree in this prompt, i disagree because some students dont actually know what they want to be when older, and i agree because some students already know what they want to some as their career. some are shy, some are scared, and some already know for sure what they want to study about. for example me, at first when i was little i didnt know what i wanted to be. my whole life till this day i am an animal lover. i rather live with animals then humans to be honest. so i thought of be a veterinarian, but people told me that i would have to do surgery on animals and stuff like that and at some things its good",3.0,2.5,3.0,3.0,2.5,3.5,3.631215810775757,3.44621205329895,3.405031442642212,3.606492042541504,3.487485408782959,3.4580154418945312
"author ralph waldo emerson wrote ""unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered,you will never grow"". doing something that you have already mastered means that you won t grow. i agree with what author ralph waldo emerson wrote because it is always good to try new things. would you want to try something new and master it or keep doing the same thing? first, people can challenge themselves with new things so they can experience life with obstacles. challenging themselves means that they will try to do something even when its hard. challenging people with hard things means that they are not going to give up even when it gets hard. why wouldn t you want to challenge yourself with new things? it s good to try new thing because doing something that you have already mastered is good but what about trying to master something else. if you want to grow even more it would be better to step out of your comfort zone and experience new things. also, having more experience with life means that you are growing up. growing up means that you would have to try new things and not only stick to one subject. wanting to try new things in life is good because your brain functions better and you get more knowledge. you will have more knowledge in your brain which means that you could master more and more things. mastering something is good because you get to have more self esteem and you will feel good about yourself. feeling good about your self is really important because you will need the motivation to master something in life. you can t master anything without having motivation because then it will be a mess and it wont turn out good. therefore, wanting to try new things is good because you can be open minded. you can also have many ideas that you could jot down. wanting to try new things gives you a lot of ideas on what you want to master. in the process of thinking of an idea to master you get so excited that there is a lot of planning and ideas in your head on what to master in. it is always good to feel confident because without confidence and motivation you wont have the energy to do what you originally wanted to do in the first place. trying new things is also good for your social life because you will come in contact with people that has so many creative ideas and you can talk to them and they would probably help you on what your ideas can be. however, not challenging yourself with new thing,having more experience with life,and wanting to try new things may not be good you could end up being comfortable at where you are at. being comfortable is good but not challenging yourself to do whats best is bad because your not giving yourself enough credit. if you don t work hard to master something that you truly want to master in then",4.0,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.8382198810577393,4.170019149780273,4.254502773284912,4.0948896408081055,4.10488748550415,4.184541702270508

"i think that failure plays a crucial role during the persuit of sucess. failure is inavoidable the path to success is not straight one. everyone fails sometime in their life . walt disney was fired for a newspaper because he lacked creativity. learn from your mistakes, if you make a mistake at least you know not to do it again. a failure might put an end to one thing (idea or opportunity) but lead you to other for example: i used to try to draw realistic people and animals with pensils, and then i found that i was better at zentangle (an art style that consists of repetitive designs and patterns. the success you end up having might not be the kind you originally had in mind. failures could lead you into in something else entirely. failure often leads to problem, working to solve problems and getting through difficult times makes you smarter and stronger as a person. by dealing with your failures, you will be more prepared and experienced in the fututre. strength, intelligente, problem solving skills, and experience are all thing that are gained from faiture and can lead to success. former british prime minister winston churchill once said that success consists of going from faiture to faiture without loss of enthusiasm. i think that faiture plays a crucial role during the pursuit of success. if there were not mistakes in life. then no one would learn from then. faiture is unavoidable, but it can be a useful tool that helps shape your future. my conclusion is faiture can change who you are and what path you re on in life, and i believe that it plays an important role in the persuit for success. mistake only makes us smarter and working to solve problems only makes us stronger. without faiture, no one would be sucessful. vocabulary: -blunder -unavoidable -principal prime -induce",3.0,3.5,4.0,4.0,3.5,3.0,3.692533493041992,3.7877163887023926,3.6675007343292236,3.6595377922058105,3.7104039192199707,3.704420328140259

"student-designed wouldn`t it be exciting for a student to create a summer projects for their fellow students to do during summer break? summer break is a time for students to have fun with their families and friends. it a time to travel to so many places like generic_city, florida, california, and so forth. furthermore, it`s great for students to complete summer projects during their break so their brains and memories can still be refreshed and for them not to forget most of the school materials they have learned before summer break. moreover, requiring students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break is a brilliant idea. but these summer projects should be student-designed because the projects will be exciting, students will be more engaged with the projects, and the student-designed projects will definitely be less harder. the first reason the summer projects should be a student-designed is because the projects will be exciting and enjoyable for other students. for example, when a students designs a kahoot for their fellow students to use to study for their test and quizzes, it will be exciting just because the students will get to choose any names they wish. so, a kahoot is a game that teachers use to create a test or quizzes for students to study to get them prepared for their test and quizzes. the kahoot can be used inside and outside of the school premises. the student designing the kahoot will get to choose how many seconds or minutes it should take the students to answer their questions. also, most teachers don`t give students enough time for them to choose their answers and that is unfair. students needs more time at least to seconds to think about the questions before answering and not rush to choose any answer just because the teacher didn`t give them enough time. students complain about how much time teachers give them because they need more time to work on their projects. for instance, teachers design boring projects like making a word puzzel about math. that is so boring because no students wants to spend their time making a word puzzle about math instead of doing other fun things like reading, going to the movie theater, going on vacation, and spending time with their families and friends. most of the students don`t find math interesting beccause they don`t like doing math. another reason is that students will be more engaged with the projects. for instance, a student designed a project about each students choosing their own topic argumentative essay like increasing the minimum wage, the college tuition, and discrimination. after that, the student will design another projects about presentations. the presentation will teach them how to present to their fellow students and also how to present in future times like jobs. the presentation will also help them master the skills of presenting. when a student designs the projects, the student will give the students extra time to work on it because teachers will give students less time on their project and expect the students",5.0,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.0,4.5,3.85249924659729,3.99471378326416,3.990143299102783,4.078473091125488,3.8280134201049805,4.035260200500488

"failure is a dreaded thing in our daily life what we try to avoid. a lot of people trying to not get in any situation where they can fail, and just a lesser layer of the people want to face with them. those people find it as a learning process and they a make great outcomes from they life. fear controlls every aspect of our life. how do we looks like? did we made the right decission? in most cases we fear about failure because we are not sure about the success or a positive outcome of the situation and the consequences of our actions. this idea divide peoples minds to two sides, two ideology: shy, safety player and brave, risk taker. both sides have pros and cons. those who chose the safety game, are using they background knowledge what they learned for long years and made it highly sure to not fail it. the word shy is not the best representation for them just in that case when something new and unknown came in to learn. they don t take the risk to fail it and they obviously will not fail because they will not even try. that can be any situation like answer the question in class; try out a sport; go to the gym; wear a new cloth; ect. the only thing what is make a gate between them and to try it is the fear. they don t take the risk and they will never know the outcome. if it s a fail then they take it as a lose. maybe the only thing what is a benefit in their thinking they will really not going to lose anything but then the successes will come lesser. also that doesn t mean they are not risk takers or they live in constant fear, it s just more safer. the cases where they are need to take steps can be not that scarry or it s doesn t need to be a big deal. these type of people are already made mistakes and the reason why then fear to try it again the previous experiences. said something dumb in class and everyone laughted; tried a sport be he/she was not succes at all; in the gym he/she felt unconfortable because he/she was not that strong like the people around them, ect. on the other side those people who trying out new thigs and got experience are usually the ones who make something in their lives what will stand for them after time. great example for this is the former british prime minister winston churchill itself. his life shows the importance of trying. if we just think about how he becamed a prime minister of the united kingdom, it s easy to realize it was not always easy for him. biography of his life tells us how many times he tried and failed but even through he gained success. people like churchill are thinkers and they take the failures as a lessons of the life. for them is a learning process",3.0,3.0,3.5,3.5,2.5,2.5,3.2559077739715576,3.133070230484009,3.1274640560150146,3.2473533153533936,3.14605975151062,2.9989237785339355
"people argue whether or not its a good idea for students to study or identify a carrier of their choice when entering high school. i agree that students should commit to a career of choice when entering high school because they ll be ahead in life than many other students who dont get the opportunity to chose a career they want to learn in high school and studying their choice of career at a younger age would have them college ready. learning a specific carrier at the time when entering high school is very beneficial to students because it would have students who do chose to learn a carrier would have them very much ahead of students who their high school s dont even offer the opportunitie to learn a carrier during their years of high school. learning and mastering a career of choice is something that students should take for granted because once mastered it can lead u to many opportunities while your in high school or have graduated. these opportunities can lead you to paid internship programs, college scholarships, and even a job right after high school. students who get to study a career of choice during their high school career would prepare them for college. having students identify a career during there high school years would give them a better feel to go to college right after high school. your resume would look much more achievable when colleges see you have earned a certificate for mastering a career you choose to learn during your time in high school. learning something you want to do in the future would prepare you for college because it would almost be the same as attending a college, but without all the nice technology or lab equipment colleges or universities have. others would disagree when i say that students should identify a career of choice when entering high school and i understand why. while some parents would want there child to study a career earlier in life, other would recommend that they shouldnt be pressured in to choosing some sort of career when entering high school because it can be really stressful for the students to already having to chose a career to pick right after middle school and other parents want there kid to enjoy life as teenager and then worry about that later. the first reason i understand, but picking a career of choice is super beneficial to that student because studying it and then getting a certificate to when passed the class will lead you to many opportunities during your years in high school and would put you ahead of many others. this is why i believe students should identify a career when entering high school. it puts them ahead of the game and prepares them for college and the future. i also believe that we should have every high school in the united states offer some sort of options of careers that students can take during there high school career and that the schools can teach in all high schools",3.5,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.5,3.7940144538879395,3.794485330581665,3.8520798683166504,3.8756072521209717,3.7603919506073,3.8097336292266846
"some schools permit their students use cellphones in classroom for educational purposes. there is so many good and bad effects allowing students use their phone for educational puroposes .they can be more bad reasons than good reason beause we have to think how really they are going to use their cellphones, and if it s for educational purpose. i think allow their cellphones to students is not a good idea because we know that we are young people, and we are not going to use our phone just for educational purposes; we are going to use :our apps , social media ,and that is going to distract our attention in class, makes us faild or test because weare not using our resource for good reason; we know there are students without resposabilities and that s what make cellphones a bad opction. some people may think that use our phone in classes can be a good idea because we are going to have more access to technology at school, and more easy research for our classwork. also people think that we are going to have more privacity for our work. students said that they can be resposinble at the moment to use their chellphones just for educational purposes. allowing cellphones for students can have good and bad effects , it can have good effects because is a easy option for students having their phone for: research information resources, have easy acess to internet ,see videos educationals abut the subject, and find deep information about the subject. the bad effect for students can be :they are going to get distracting , they are not going to do their classwork,and for all that reasons they can lose their classes. my first reason is cellphones in class are not good tools for students ,because cellphones distract and make students lose their attention to class. my second reason is cellphones is not a thing that we need for learn because our parents, teachers ,family in their time was no cellphone ,and they learn by other resources like books ,so is not a thing that we really need. there are computers we can use them for when we really needed . my third reason is that cellphone is not necessary for our educational purpose because we can have better resources than a cellphone ; we have the most beautiful thing in this world and that are books our better resource. some schools allow their students to use their cellphone to a educational purpose they think that is a good idea to have cellphones in their classroom but in my opinion is a distracting thing ,and is not necessary for our educational purpose ; we have good tools for example one are the books and internet but not using our cellphones at class because we know that we are not goin to use for educational purpose, and cellphone are going to distract us.",2.5,2.5,3.0,2.5,2.0,2.5,3.084516763687134,2.9805028438568115,2.968580484390259,3.08113956451416,2.864586114883423,2.948880434036255
"i agree with this statement because, positivity is the key to success, if your always being negative and saying negative stuff it will be hard for you to find success. my dad once told me that whatever you do in life and even if you fail you should always tackle it with a postive attitude no matter what. having a positive attitude has great benefits when it comes to work place,your personal business and even life in general, being rude or disrespectful to people won t pay, there is a saying that says what goes around comes around, so if you treat people with a negative attitude, in the near future somebody will treat you the same way. attitude is very important in life, attitude determines if your going to be a better person in life or a bad person, attitude determines how well you are in treating people with respect. a good attitude goes a long way, even if you don t have enough money or you struggle to pay your bills having a good attitude and being postive will land you into a good job and also by meeting great people. having a bad attitude can even ruin things that you know how to do well, if your suppose to be doing something and you do it with a bad attitude it won t turn out good, you will always end up doing something wrong because of your attitude. at the end of the day attitude counts, treating people with respect is very important and it will take you places you have never thought about.",3.5,3.5,3.5,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.6426687240600586,3.472877264022827,3.496922016143799,3.5714640617370605,3.4338669776916504,3.6274797916412354
"i disagree with my school adding one and a half more hours for these reasons there is no time for after school activities, going to have to give the teachers more, and your going to have to face a lot of students sleeping in class because lets admit it school is kind of boring. one reason the school board shouldnt add one and a half more hours is because there will be no time for after school activities. for example if generic_name has soccer practice anymore. another example is if generic_name hosts computer club she cant host it because there is no time for hosting her club. another example is if they and one hour and a half then there would be no time to have fun at school. the second reason the school board should not add one hour and a half is because your going to have to give the teachers more money for the extra hours. an example is that if there child is sick and they need to pick them up but they cant because they are teaching. another example is if generic_name is the boss of the school board and the extra one hour and a half she is going to have to do extra work so she make sure that everyone gets there pay check. another example is teachers are going to have to make sure they have enough work for the extra time and plus they have to grade all of the work the students do. the last example is that the bell schedule will be different and the people who work are going to do a lot of work to schedule lunch and everything. another reason i disagree with my school adding one hour and a half more time is that the teachers are going to have to face a lot of tied and sleeping students. another example is if half of the students are sleeping and tiered there is no point of teaching them because they are likely not going to do work or forget everything they learned that day. another example is that the teachers will be angry from all the students with their heads down because they are tiered. another example is that students and teachers have family and places to be. another reason there shouldnt be one hour and a half is that everyone has their schedules like for example shower,homework,eat,sleep and they wont have time to do all of their schedule this is why i disagree with my school adding one and a half more hours for these reasons there is no time for after school activities, going to have to give the teachers more, and your going to have to face a lot of students sleeping in class because lets admit it school is kind of boring.",3.0,3.5,3.0,3.5,4.0,3.5,3.1640594005584717,3.109168529510498,3.1939432621002197,3.1794776916503906,3.147368907928467,3.206247329711914
"on a human, the brain is the strongest part of their body. it control your body. also, world s one of the biggest thing from a human brain is imagination. more than years ago, people used their mind to build machines, planes, rockets, television , bridges, etc. most of the things were build my their own imagination. our world s one of the brilliant scientist of all time albert einstein said, ""imagination is more important than knowledge."" i think that imagination is more important than knowledge in a lot of ways. ""imagination"" is the power of mind to make something creative. sometimes when you imagine something that you know you will do it no matter who stops you, it may come to real life and change the whole world. it can change a lot of thing in the world that you didn t thought of. for example: think that you designed a machine from your imagination about a robot maid who can help you to clean your house , do your laundry, make you dinner, washing the dishes, etc. from your idea, you made the robot and it worked just the you wanted it to work. and then your robot went to the market and the people brought it and loved the machine. how would you feel when you see your robot went viral in the world and people liking it? your robot machine went from an a imaging thing to a big successful robot machine. also it helps your mind get stronger. when you thinking about anything, your brain is running from one place to another place to get the next task. in a human brain, we do % conscious and % unconscious things everyday. you are learning something new everyday, your brain collecting data based what you do in a everyday life basis. when you imaging something, your brain brings back the data from your past and puts it in your imagination. in that way,you know what you should in your imaginary work. also, in that way your brain are becoming more conscious by your little thinking process and it s making your brain stronger everyday. imaginary can make you an open minded person. if you are good at imaging, when you are gonna talk to other people and they tries to explain you their situation, first, you will imagine yourself into that situation. second, you will understand what they have been went through. then you will think what should i do to make that person feel better. next, you will give them some helpful advises that will make them better. if they feel safe around you, they will be more comfortable to tell more about them in future. in conclusion, i think imagination is better than knowledge. it makes you a good person, it makes you open minded, it helps your brain to get stronger. and that way you will be able to help others",3.5,2.5,3.5,2.5,3.0,3.0,3.6296472549438477,3.7262487411499023,3.72092604637146,3.5480434894561768,3.5995113849639893,3.6575305461883545
"do you think people accomplish more if they are always doing something or do you think inactivity serve as a purpose? thomas jefferson wrote,""determine never to be idle...it is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing.""many people think that they accomplish more if they are always doing something. when people are always doing something,they are always learning new things and gaining experiences. some people think that the more they do ,the more they achieve because being idle will not lead you to success and nobody is going to come and accomplish things for you. therefore much may be done if people are always doing something certainly some people think that inactivity serve as a purpose because people can be physically inactive but mentally active and they might be creating wonderful things in their minds. still others think that being inactive does not mean that they are being idle because they already achieved their dreams and they are satisfied with what they have so that is why they see inactivity as a purpose. others might think that not everyone have the opportunities to being always doing something and they do not have more option that being inactive. however, people accomplish more if they are always doing something because they learn new things in the process of doing something. they learn more about themselves and about others. they learn how to interact and connect with others and how to fit in different environments. people who are always doing something gain more and new experiences that will help them later in life also gaining experiences and being in different types of environments surrounded by different kind of people will help them improve their mental maturity and also help them to to have a different perspective of see world and life. in other words people who are always doing something accomplish more,and learn more how to interact with others and gain new experiences. furthermore,people accomplish more if they are always doing something because the more you do the more you achieve. if people do not work and make an effort for the things they want to accomplish nobody is going to do it for them because each person is the author of their own success .some people might be waiting that the things they want fall from the sky ,or appear magically in their hands making no effort to accomplish them and idles will not lead you to success .people who are successful today is because they were always working hard and making their best effort to accomplish their goals,they know what they wanted and they were persistent and did not give up on their goals. if people want to be successful in life they have to know that failure is part of achieving success and just have to keep trying and do not give up until they achieve their goals. therefore people s success is based on the effort they put to achieve it because the more they do the more they achieve. in fact, people accomplish more if they are",4.0,3.5,4.0,4.0,3.5,4.0,3.4900596141815186,3.390324354171753,3.4134442806243896,3.4857966899871826,3.3253610134124756,3.407442092895508
"first impressions are almost impossible to change this is true but they can also slightly change a little bit over time. i personally agree that is almost impossible to change an impression about someone so lets say that i agree and disagree because the statement is right but not everyone is the same, your thoughts and the way you think are different from everyone else, so the way you feel about a person could change over time. the first impression of a person about you could change over time just like your first impression about someone you ve never met before could change as time passes and yall get know each other and hang out, go out to eat just like in a relationship, when the girl meets the guy and he looks so handsome, respectful, polite, nice, generous, very responsible from her point of view, when his at school, work, even when his home or even to the point of calling him sexy even if he is the skinniest guy ever you would tell him ""wow baby, you re so sexy"", even if his not you would say it because you wouldn t want him to feel bad or anything to ruin that bond but when you guys start talking even more, start to hangout more often that bond will start to grow stronger in confidence and trust so when that time hits, it gives us a whole degree spin now you start to be more open with your partner and you actually start saying the real things, im not saying you have to lie but people in specific try to cover their lies with other lies and some times it dont even work or it don t add up at all but what im saying is that when that right time actually hits you start being more open and you re not afraid and for the same the reason, you guys develop your ways up and work it out to the point of building a really strong trust, that confidence in you guy s eyes, that key to your heart and let everything be free. it will take a while for you to see the prove but probably not to long but the results will come at one point and don t doubt it. however, with your first impressions you will represent yourself to the people or the way you act or the way you act in the beginning it will make them know if your child dish, immature, or the opposite. if you put that respect and honesty in the beginning people will treat you with respect but if you like to mess with people yell at them without respect don t expect something else because it will come back to you and there s this verse in the bible that i like that says "" what you plant, thats what will grow"" i don t think i wordily got it right how i said so what its meaning is if you re a lair don t be mad",2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,3.479555606842041,3.2448153495788574,3.3654990196228027,3.4292867183685303,3.2530572414398193,3.238759756088257
"students should take four years of high school, instead of three years, because students can have more time to learn, students can have electives, students can enjoy their summer vacations and their evenings, and finally students have more time to do stuff. althought some schools think that is better to offer programs that allow high school students to graduate in three years instead of the traditional four years, actually students should take four years of high school. first students can have more time to learn. for example, in a year students can learn much stuff, and they have energy to learn, in the summer students just have two months to study, so they don t have much time to learn all the stuff they learn at school, in evenings students have three months to study, the classes start a pm and end at pm, so at that time students are tired and the don t have much energy, so it s difficult to concentrated and learn all the stuff. second students can have electives, students can have classes like gym, art, and music students can discover new talents in that classes, also students relax their minds in that classes and enjoy the school. third students can enjoy their summer vacations, students get tired for study ten months, is good that they can relax and pass time with their family and friends, so their mind is clear, and when they start study they have good attitude, energy and they want to learn new stuff. finally students can have more time to do stuffs, because they can go home and do their homeworks, study for exams, pass time with their family, and have good sleep hours, they don t have to worry about go to school in evenings, they can relax. students should take four years of high school, so they have more time to learn, they can have electives and learn new things, they don t have to study on the summer and they can enjoy their vacation and evenings with family and friends, and finally they can have more time to do sttufs.",4.0,3.0,3.0,3.5,2.5,3.5,3.4609365463256836,3.3006484508514404,3.2350425720214844,3.4466052055358887,3.261406898498535,3.3482117652893066
"technology allows people to complete many tasks without having contact with others. everyday after school my brother and i go to the library to do our homework, when we get there i don t have any contact with him nor him with me. nowadays, when i go to the library i can see many people sitting there, staring at the screen of a computer without having contact with the other person that it is near them. having access to technology has positive effects but it also have negative effects. the limitation use of technology has negative effects on people s lives because it keeps us away from the ones that are near us, it can damage our way of living, and also it can make us to become addicted to it. while we are in touch with technology, we are keeping away our self from the ones that are near us. for example, i have this friend we have always eat lunch together none of us have a cellphone, but one day my friend came to school with a cellphone that her mom bought for her. we were eating lunch, i was talking to her, but she was not listening to me because she was more into her cellphone than me. technology can allow us to have contact with the ones that are far away from us, but we need to manage our time we can talk to them when we are alone and not when we are near a person that we can talk to. having any type of technology near us while we are with somebody else it is not a good idea. therefore, one day i decided to let my friend being herself with her cellphone, and i stop eating lunch with her. technology send me away from her even though maybe she did not want that to happened. from that day i learned that if i want to keep the person that it is always near me, i just need to give them more attention instead of giving all my attention to a cellphone. to continue, technology can damage our way of living, it can effect us in a way that we have not even think about it. for instance, when i turned seventeen years old my parents bought me a cellphone, from then i was too lazy to do my homework and refuse to talk to them because i have a cellphone and i can be in contact with the ones that are not near me. access to technology made me lazy and careless about school. one day my parents decided to took my cellphone for a week i was really mad at them that i stop eating and then i got sick. meanwhile, technology can help people with their tasks, but it can also make people careless about important things that can be useful for their future. some say that the use of technology have a great positive effect in our life, but i disagree with it because the use of technology it just stop us",3.5,3.5,3.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.8651251792907715,3.7275843620300293,3.7773289680480957,4.091277122497559,3.8266284465789795,3.870363235473633

"in some societies, students are expected to identify a career by the time they enter high school. their courses of study in high school are selected to guide them toward a specific career. many young students do not have the capacity of choosing a career at that time of age. i believe, that kinds mentality about their career will change through out high school. student should not be required to choose a career by the time they enter to high school, because they are inexperienced to know what they want, students could choose the wrong career, and unhappy of wasting their time on a career they are going to change their mind on. inexperienced of not knowing what they want,students could make the take wrong choices about their future career. when students enter to high school they are normally around fourteen years old, young students of that age are normally not worry about their future career yet. students mentality starts changing abut their career when they are having more knowledge about what they really what to be. when kids are around sixteen is when are maturing about their future and looking at things differently. students do not have the capacity of choosing their whole future career at the young of age. when students are force to choose a career when they first enter to high school, they could choose the wrong career. most students know that choosing the wrong career could affect the later on in the future. lets say that they choose a career when they enter to high school, but they are unhappy. they are going to be stuck their whole life time with something that does not makes them happy. when people work with things they like or enjoy they attempt to work harder and better. most people change their mind almost everyday about something they like or do not like, well it is the same with choosing a career. wasting time is something no one likes to do, and specially when is about their future. making kids choose their career at a young age could mess them up and they would have to do things all over again. when choosing the wrong career, accepting the consequences and restart over again with a new career of their choice. making good research,planing things out first with a good process will help with their future career. most students are not prepare to pick their future career during high school. most students have no knowledge of what they want to be later in life. some students could make the wrong choice of picking a career they do not want. changing their mind in a career could also make them unhappy of have wasted their time with something they was not interested in. students should have enough experience and good knowledge of what their future career before they choose what they want to be.",3.5,3.0,4.0,3.5,3.5,4.0,3.6489453315734863,3.5916593074798584,3.5588903427124023,3.6131060123443604,3.512498378753662,3.595184326171875

"scientist albert einstein once said, "" imagination is more important than knowledge."" i agree, why do i agree with scientist albert einstein. when you use your imagination, you can create it in your mind first, you can invent it, you can make the world a better place with it. first, when you use imagination you create it in your mind, you can go to your happy place and just build it you see how it s. your brain helps you imagine it right, for example in the game called fortnite, you imagine what you want to build before you build it and how it s going to look like. in knowledge you just know it you can t make it more beautiful. when you use imagination you can see the problems that might happen when you are trying to build something in your mind. that s why imagination is more important than knowledge. furthermore, imagination can help you invent stuff like flying cars. i can use my imagination and and think about what can i do to build a flying car and boom! now you know how you can build it. you need imagination more than knowledge. i am not going to say you can t build flying cars with knowledge but, with imagination you can make it better. imagination is literary a image in your mind, its like you drawing the things you want to invent on a piece of paper, and just adding some colors to it. in knowledge it s like you knowing the answer to a math question or just about any question. finally, imagination makes the world a better place, how does imagination make the world a better place. well it has a lot of reasons but the best reason is, it makes people happy if people are happy then there is no violence in the world. if we don t use our imagination there would be no light bulbs or nothing. if you dreamed about something, with your imagination you can accomplish that dream and make your life better, and maybe that dream was you becoming a teacher than you re making your life better and the world a better place. to conclude, scientist albert einstein said, ""imagination is more important than knowledge ."" and here is why with imagination you can create in your mind first, you can invent it, you can make the world a better place with it. if you can imagine something than you do it if you imagined it right.",3.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.6330673694610596,3.688546895980835,3.6705322265625,3.671353816986084,3.693702220916748,3.7057812213897705
"student and teachers are have opposing views on working together for various reasons. however, according to new stanford research, when people are treated as partners working together their motivation, student are able to communicate with each other, therefore creating a better final product. working in team also prepares students for future careers and job. whoever they will be required to learn to cope with other people and personalities, it is valued by employers. even though students are not agree with each other all the time, working together is ore beneficial than working alone. every body ha heard someone in their life say "" two minds are better than one"" before right, this quote has never range more, and all of the idea it promotes reflect crystal clear off of group work. working in a group can be drastically reduce the amount of work you need to do as well as make thing of more efferent, whether it be a group project paperer presentation. because it cuts down on how much work one person has to do. it allows for group to achieve more as alone. things are also finished much quicker because of the way many people can split up different jobs in a group an people with different skill sets can do what they are best at and do not have to worry about what they are bad at, this broader range of skill can also be used to help other people members develop their own by learning from their team members. the diversity found within a group of people is one of most powerful resources a person can have when it comes to finishing a task. it lends a group of people to have many more ideas to come up with and bounce off of because many people are working ""the best way to have good idea is to have a lot of the a quote from linus pauting dealing with dilemma new idea s. when dealing with abdicating an idea from thin air, it be best to have multiple people instant of one because it brings multiple ideas all have fair and different point rather than multiple ideas no opposition or diversity. another benefit of having multiple people working in one group is that this can cause an evolutionary like phenomenon with multiple, stronger idea that complete and mulute, creating one in tribute and exceptional idea. this also comes with the help of a group, as a group can decide which idea would be main idea and smoothe out the edyes. another problem that can come up is well problem. having a group of people can become extremely helpful for solving a problem that may come up in situations where a problem can arise, having a group of people can allow for quick and easy way to get out of a situation. now working in a group does not have its advantage but some things are best done alone though working in a group can seem to be good working alone can be better depending on the situation. being",3.5,2.0,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.0,3.6908161640167236,3.2705156803131104,3.459763765335083,3.5542922019958496,3.317063570022583,3.3173611164093018
"summer breaks in most countries are - days long. students mostly enjoy the summer by going to a vacation or doing fun stuff. from students point of view, day summer break is the last thing they want to lose. however, most student lose track of their studies after spending such a long break away from school. furthermore, being days away from your frisbee practice would massively impact your game; and the same applies to to studying, you will forget most of the lessons that you ve learned. one might say, ""well there are summer classes to keep students connected with their studies."" but to be absolutely honest, no one wants to go to school in a hot summer day. we all want to lay low and have a cold drink in beach while listening to the satisifying sound of waves. what is the solution? put an end to long summer breaks (not completely removing them), and instead give students a week off after every week of studying. it gives students and the faculty a brief break after every week, and also it gives students time to work on their important projects. for instance, if i m studying history of us museums, i can get a chance to explore the museums and write an article of my own observation about museums in my area. student can t get everything done on weekends so they need more time. teachers on the other hand can keep track of the students during the -day break and ask them for their progression. moreover, this gives students to participate in community services and/or religious services, which in my opinion, are crucial in building one s character. the summer break, however, is still there but shrinked to weeks, giving students a chance to go on vacations and trips but not for long. all in all, -day break after every week of school keeps students involved and connected to their studies, community and religion; while giving them the freedom they need to enjoy their summer without losing track of all the studies.",4.5,5.0,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,3.8887951374053955,4.165616989135742,4.21821928024292,4.100144386291504,4.113000869750977,4.271356582641602

"i oppose the idea of schools offering distance learning as an option for students to attend classes,this is because not all students benefit from attending classes from home,and online. giving students the choice to attend classes online is a big responsibility; causing the demand that they must follow instructions,and complete class work tasks. it is true that most students have no problem with this , they complete their agenda and assignments; thus why they are more comfortable with this method of learning. but this method of learning is not always the case for some students, because it gives this students an opportunity to become nonchalant about their classes; consequently, they start to fool around and get distracted at times. attitudes like this can lead to: not meeting up with deadlines, missing daily classworks, poor understanding skills, and ultimately failure. students that have poor learning skills would be incompetant to take online classes, which mean at all costs their must be guidance for this kind of students. it is possible that due to a lack of connection with the teacher in the classroom and the student, it is most likely they would not have the chance to ask further questions or recieve reliable advices from a teacher. in some cases students can benefit from seeking assurance from other students with more knowlegde about the subject, group activites ,and asistance. in conclusion, distance learning and it s method of teaching is not helpful to every student, because a stystem of learning that benefits all students,and give students opportunity for futher understanding is more beneficial.",3.0,2.0,3.5,3.0,3.0,2.5,3.7419490814208984,3.7471230030059814,3.6388370990753174,3.826639413833618,3.7857108116149902,3.864424705505371

"schools should not have a four day school because, some students may not have time to stay more hours, some students have a part-time job and others help parents to taking care of younger siblings. however, some people have different points of view by, believing that extending schools days that benefits the energy, resources and even helping students to learnd more. an example, is just having four days work or school week. this adaptation can have good and bad benefits. some people believe that, havig just four days of school is a bad idea because a student will not have time to work or do other activities. a reason of this is because schools days will be more longer and there is going to be less time for them to do activities, student will not have time to work and help their parents taking care of their siblings. one of a major idea is students will not have time to do their activities. since school is going to end late. students need to finish all school assignments. however, elementary schools will end later that high schools or middle schools. that will not letf them much longer for them to pass time with their family. students will be more eshausted, that can be really worrying because their grades can go down. parents will not be happy with their kids grades. this adaptation can be really helpfult for some people. however, it can affect some other people lifes. another reason is some students have a part-time job. they will no have time to work and even if, they have the time it s going to be difficult for them. an example, if students get out from school late they have to run to their house to get ready to go work because they may be late for work. however, going to work for them is not that easy some of them don t have their license yet. some of them have to walk even take a public bus. before considering the benefits of four days of school week there are a lot more disadvantages that can affect students with their normal life. the last reason is teenagers helps parents with their siblings. although that can change because if students have to stay more at school their schedules will be longer than a normal. an example, parents will have to find someone that can stay with their kids and that means that is going to be more cost. parents will be unhappy paying more money to a babysitter. however, is reallly hard to find someone that can be dependable. even if teenegers have the time to take care of their siblings, they will not have time to do their own stuff because they have to do two things at the same time. in conclusion, these ten hours school not just affect students will affect the whole family because students will end really eshausted even, teachers will get tired too. after considering all the benefits and disadvantages there is a point about conserve energy and resources",4.0,3.0,4.0,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.585926055908203,3.3507254123687744,3.440539836883545,3.4765920639038086,3.3583359718322754,3.4385979175567627
"adopting the failure is the way to become master and complete our goals. everyone have experimented failure in some point of their lives. as the british prime minister winston churchill once said ""success consists of going from failure to failure without loss the enthusiasm"". but should we really continue pursuing success after fail many times, even knowing that, it might be really difficult?. although some say that we should give up after fail multiply times. actually, we should not lose the enthusiasm after have failed in something that we wanted more than one time because, being consistent is a way the learn and become successful. also, failure gives us more experience and mastery before we complete our goal. those who believe that we should lose the enthusiasm after fail many times in what we want, have their reasons. they think that being pushing your self getting stress by starting something that you couldn t have done before, is a way to waste time because, you re not going to complete it anyways. they also believe that it s really hard to start over again knowing that if you try it one more time you might fail it all the same even though you don t achieve success. one reason why we should not lose the enthusiasm after failure is that people learn from their mistakes. a way to learn is being consistent and do not give up, even if there are many difficulties that make us think that we should leave our goals and dreams. as example of this is my friend, generic_name, who had to take his math test multiply times. first, he took it at the first time without even study, as result of that he didn t pass it as well. second, the teacher gave him a second opportunity to take it. this time he studied much better than the first time but he didn t pass it again, he felt stressful ""what s going on to me"" he said because, he knew that he needed to pass that test. then, he asked to the teacher for a third chance to take it. but this time he studied really hard for many hours, he also knew what the test was going to be like because he had taken it before. as result he passed the test with a good score. what happened to generic_name is a perfect example why should not lose the enthusiasm after have failed something couple times. if generic_name hadn t been consistent by studying and taking it more than one time, he wouldn t have passed the text. therefore we should never lose the enthusiasm after fail many times. other reason why we should keep the enthusiasm even if we have failed something is that, failure gives us more experience and confidence before we complete or reach our goals. as example of this is my self. the last year i had lost to do, such as school, work and other responsibilities that required me to drive. then, my parents decided that it was time to",3.5,2.5,3.5,3.5,2.5,2.5,3.4473512172698975,3.4249167442321777,3.3657264709472656,3.39953351020813,3.3119888305664062,3.307866334915161

"dear school board, why does a student s education matter? to me, it is extremely important because it can affect them for their entire life in positive or in negative ways. it could lead them to a job with a seven figure salary, or to work a part-time job at a fast food restaurant making minimum wage. what s also important to me is the learning experience. i believe learning should be fun, interesting, and not stressful for students. that s why i agree with the school board s plan to extend the school day by one and a half hours, because that way, students wouldn t feel rushed and would have more time to learn, teacher will have more time to teach and using new ways, and the school year would be a little shorter. to begin with, i agree with the school board to extend the school day because students wouldn t feel rushed and they would have more time to learn. right now, each of our periods are only about minutes, which i think really isn t a lot of time to learn once you start working. if one and a half hours is added to the current school day, we would have at least an hour for each class. this way, the students would have more time to complete projects, assignments, or just have more time to really understand the subject without feeling rushed. i know this because right now, i am working on a project in science class that we only have two class periods to finish, which totals for just about one and a half hours! i am not saying that a little push isn t necessary or beneficial, but the extra time would definitely boost the quality of the student s work at our school without rushing them. secondly, i think the school board should increase the school day by one and a half hours because that will let teachers have more time to teach, while using unique ways to do so. with the students having more time to learn, the teachers could potentially also have more time to actually create a better learning experience. extending the day ensures that teachers would be able to thoroughly explain new concepts and materials, while also teaching using better or more effective methods that wouldn t have been possible because of the shortage of time. for instance, sometimes we have educational scavenger hunts, where the teacher lays the information throughout the campus and we would have to find them. the issue is, we ve never been able to finish, not because it wasn t possible to, but because there simply wasn t enough time. those kinds of educational activities are, in my opinion, very fun, but it s also effective. so if we have more time, i am sure that some teachers would plan and teach more using different ways which are beneficial to both the student and the teacher. lastly, the school board s plan to extend one and a half hours to the school day is",5.0,5.0,4.5,5.0,5.0,4.5,3.864488124847412,4.356168270111084,4.6331682205200195,4.068181991577148,4.342220783233643,4.600878715515137

"some school districts offer programs that allow high school students to graduate in three years instead of the traditional four years. i agree with this position. i believe that it is a good idea for students to finish high school in three years and enter college one year early. although, some people think that it is not a good idea for students enter college or the work force one year early, nevertheless it can be helpful, because it can help students to start early to college, then they can have enough time to choose what they will want to study, and it also going to promote them to be eficients and take adventage of the time, they will have. when people have to take a important decision, regularly, they think and they look carefully at all their options. if the students graduate one year early, they will earn time to correctly choose what profession they going to take, and then they will have enough time to elect the college or university where they feel comfortables to go. this is significant, because of one decision depend the future; the experiences that people going to live. with enough time students can give attention to their most important interests, thoughts, and consider possibles changes if it s require. also people can take adventages of the time that they have, one year is not too much, but in one year is the opportuny for students to select a exceptional career and work and what they always dreamed. the time is a investment and students have to take advantage of that. some parents, students, and techers think that if the students graduate a year early, they don t will have time free to play, to share with their families, or to do others activities. the reality is that it going to improve the performance of the students. this method will catch the attention of them and it will show them their priorities. the children have the right to have their free time, but also the parents have the labor to teach them that are precedences that they have to comply with. for example, i took english , in summer school in generic_city, but i was living in generic_city, i drove every morning, one hour to arrive to my summer school, it was hard wake up early and then drive, but now, i m sure that it was the best desicion because i m at few steps of my graduation. people always have to remind that to can get extraordinary rewards, people have to do extraordinary efforts. on the other hand, some people are not agree with those that offer the special program to graduate early. the opposition believe that students are not sufficiently prepare to graduate before of the schedule time. the contrary side, also think that students have to complete all their high school years to be ready to go to the college or the work. people that is in the opposite side not coincide with the programs that allow high school students to graduate in",4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.5,3.601308584213257,3.443179130554199,3.376753091812134,3.52824330329895,3.3764002323150635,3.4172723293304443

"i disagree, i think if you are honest all the time, you might say some mean things to a person, which might hurt their feelings. first, being honest is good, that s how you earn trust. however, keep some things to yourself if you think it s not positive to say to another. second, it might make the person feel bad if you do say something harsh to them. lastly, a person might see you differently if you re honest constantly, whether it was nice comment or a mean comment you said. firstly, there isn t a lot of honesty when there needs to be at times. sometimes you have to say what s right in order to not hurt someones feelings from what you said. for example, your friend and yourself have to be honest in some cases to earn each others trust for the other person to be honest in return. secondly, not being honest might lead you to trouble, if they might have found out you lied to them later. they might give you respect if you re not lying to them and not saying malicious stuff about a person. secondly, if you are honest ""all the time"" some people might see you ask a snitch from the way you are saying everything to a person. for example, a teacher comes up to you and asked you a question on what a person did you would have to be honest and say the truth. i also think that ""honesty"" and ""truth"" are a similar word because, you have to do both in order to be honest constantly. the truth is that honesty can get you into a very bad situation if you have to be completely honesty with a teacher. by the wrong person you talk to, you might accidentally start a riot. lastly, you should be careful on how honest you are to people, because you don t know whether they are going through some stuff you are pointing out to them. being truthful to someone and saying everything to them might make them upset on how you view stuff in the world also. honesty is like an opinion that may cause someone that went through something upset them drastically. this is why i disagree that honesty is the best policy. from the situation you are in say respectful stuff towards the person. it might make you a better person if you are not saying negative things towards a person too. in conclusion, i disagree with ""honesty is the best policy"" by the situation you are in with the person and what they are going through. may cause them to dislike themselves in a way you wouldn t know.",4.0,4.0,3.5,3.5,4.0,4.0,3.859832286834717,4.196980953216553,4.196723937988281,4.098270416259766,4.1253533363342285,4.2610087394714355

"i agree that we accomplish more if we are always doing something. i think it does because it helps us learn on what to do. we can teach other the same way as well. we have other people helping us in different ways. for example, we can teach them different ways on doing things they don t feel comforable and that they would feel conforable if they keep doing it. although it may take time to get use to it they would have experience at the end. also those people can teach other people. learning new stuffs is hard but if its a good idea people should do it. i think we can make a difference by learning new things in our lifes. for example, if there were new ways by playing video games then people should learn it. although it can get people mad if they lose or anything else. it can be helpful to others in the world. i think they would know a lot more if they did. we would get a lot done quicker if we had a method on it. for example, other people helping out on big protects to make it happen and work every well. although it would need a lot of taking to one each other. it can help by not getting to one an other. getting to know new people by doing things. if your not doing things you won t get anything accomplish in life. for example, if you don t do well in school that can effect your life by getting a job. people can stop being lazy and do their work. they can ask for help if they need it. if they ask they would have a lot accomplish.",3.5,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.5,3.6391592025756836,3.463090181350708,3.481482744216919,3.591904878616333,3.4305951595306396,3.6093084812164307

"according to the washington post, there has been an increase in student population in schools around the u.s. they are being crowed with more and more students every year. because of this more students in the future will need to take online classes at home instead of going to the school and doing so. being able to do class work at home, will benefit the students that live far from the school; they attend and make it easier for them to get the education they still need. distance learning will also help the students manage there time better. because of the fact the students don t have to go and spend time at the actual school. the travel time it takes the students to go and come back from school would not be a factor anymore if they attend online classes in there house. a reason distance learning could benefit students is that it could improve student attendance. if you were sick and could not go to school you can work on the things you will miss at school. another thing is that for the students that struggle with transportation to get to school on certain days; instead they can finish the school work at home which would be easier instead of stressing over how they are going to get to school. the way it would benefit students is that it will help them focus more on work than instead of focusing on transportation to school. this could also benefit on the days that school gets canceled. for example school gets canceled because of a snow day or some other reason. something that is really big on news right now is the outbreak of the coronavirus. the u.s. is deciding to close schools in certain states around the country. distance learning could benefit by if some schools were to actually close, it would not affect student education as much as it would if there was not a way to learn at home. if there was a snow day and some parents did not want there kids to walk to school on the sidewalk because it was dangerous; and they could drive them either because of the fact they had to go to work. a easier and safer way would be just to have them do the school tasks in there house. in the past when it rained or snowed really hard and the next day i had to go to school sometimes the roads would be flooded or their would have been an acident that prevent me from getting to school. in those cases it would be nice to have the option to learn from home instead of going through the trouble to figure out a way on how to get to school. in some cases it is better for the students to work at school than it is at home. a reason being is at school they can meet new friends and be in a better working and studying envoirment. another thing would be that their are less things that could",3.5,3.5,3.5,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.861194372177124,4.084082126617432,4.137418270111084,4.128882884979248,4.108926296234131,4.1422810554504395

"techonology has becoming powerful that let students and teachers to give and receive classes online. disadvantages or adventages of taking classes online? these question are faced today by students deciding taking online classes. often students work part or full time jobs while going to school or collage so their time is valuable. these students want to make the right decisions in choosing classes so knowing the disaventage and adventages is important. i believe that online classes is a good opportunity for students as it gives flexibility, they often offer any type of class desired and provide access to faculty, and they often offer accelerate courses. to begin with, one of the best adventage of online classes is flexibility. a student can usually take the course any time during the day or week. while there are custom essay writing and researching assigments to complete, the precise time to take the class often depends on the student s desire. students who work are able to take the class based on their schedule. many students work on afternoon. the flexibility makes it possible for a person to complete the course, while attending school or collage courses in person might be imposible due to their work schedules. secondly, another great adventage of online courses is that almost any type of course can be found online. distance learning course are often avaliable from a number of collages. a person can simply use the google to find a class. while most people believe a disadventage of taking online courses is that the students can not have access to faculty a member, the fact is that many online courses offer a grater access to faculty. shy students are able to ask questons and receive the answer back almost inmediately. lastly, online courses are convenient for most undergraduate and graduate students who can study when they want and they can finish writing or researching assigments based on their own person schedules. the fact is online classes offer flexibility and conveniece that are often vital to students who work and have families. in addition, many students are looking for classes that are advanced to complete the course faster. the best way to advance in the class is to make it online because in the regular schools it takes a long time as there are students who get behind and the teachers wait for them since everyone has to go at the same time. to conclude, with online classes, students do all the work at their own pace. as long as they meet their deadlines and participate apropriately online. also, studying online requires more self motivation and time mangement skills because students will spend a lot of time on their own without someone physically close to keep them focused on deadlines. online course will not only teach students geology or poetry, it will also help them become more self motivated, a trait that will make them stand out in the workplace and beyond. it will teach educators to be mature choosing right decisions as it will make them explore more and be",4.5,3.5,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.5,3.880420207977295,4.382533550262451,4.34104585647583,4.113452434539795,4.195219039916992,4.214881896972656

"i despise it when someone your close to says ""you can t be like me you have to be better than that."" what right do you have to speak on what i have done, when you have done things people could not even imagine? this is why when it comes to someone you look up too or base your personality off of, make sure it is one who has credibility. like people always say ""you are who you hang around with."" for example, being around friends who act in illegal activities your bound to do those things too. a man with honor, integrity, and takes responsibility for what he does will be respected because of his behavior. being a good role model is especially true when it comes to children. for example, have you ever had a little cousin or your bestfriend s baby sibling copy the same exact words that come out of your mouth? be careful what you talk about around a kid because they repeat what you say; furthermore, it might not seem like it, but they can process everything you say. this is how in parts of the country people have various accents and pronounce words differently. when you grow up in a certain neighborhood or even in you household, while aging you will be using the different terms and phrases people around you use because that s all you ever known growing up. so staying away from words that can t be used in a school or around familly is your best bet. a celebrity has an even greater audience when it comes to setting an example for others. people of all types of ages watch them, they are the ones who set the trends, the news revolves around, and control social media. when a celebrity messes up they get the most hate; however, if a celebrity does a great deed like a charity event then they re praised for it. they attract the most attention and most of those eyes are teenagers, who need the most advice and a figure to follow. for teenagers this is who decides for them if they ll be on the streets or in the books because famous people are who they spend most of their time with. teenagers are always watching, whether on social media, a reality show, a sports game, or a movie, celebrities are dominating the world right now. no mater who it is, a person always have some type of influence on somebody. that is why you should just hold that anger in next time you get in a fight because people are watching. do some charity or show them you cleaning up the environment; in addition, just effect others in a positive way. however some would say setting example does not matter or no one pays attention to that, it is suprising how many people are effected by a person s behavior. showing a good example with behavior does not necessarily mean change who you are, it just means be careful of the words that are",4.5,4.0,5.0,4.5,4.5,4.0,3.8751609325408936,3.9609720706939697,4.117846965789795,4.061197757720947,4.06154203414917,4.067336559295654
"sometimes take classes from home not can be helf students to improve their learning. although some schools offer distances learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way online or video conferencing. i disagree to students take the classes on home because they not learn the same as in the school, if students have a question, or doubt did not have a teacher to asking, and students did not have the same opcion like others students. the students who take classes from home, not learn the same in the school and this can be are difficult for them. for example, most of students lose the test because they forget the impormation that they learn in online classes and the time of the test they not remember enyting. sincerity, take classes from home it is difficult for students the short learning because they not have the same capacity like others students. the students can be improve in the school more that from home, because from home they teaching they self. in addition, most of school believe that give classes from home can be helf students, but this is a big error. if the students have a question, or doubt did not have a teacher to asking since, they answer themself. for example, sometimes the students do not know how to make homework, project, etc and they need someone to helf them. also, every students need a teacher to explain everything that they need to make, and if they make the classes from home is impossible to make the thing good if did not have a teacher. it not the same to make the calsses online or in school because in online it is person who teaching for only a short moment, nevertheless in the school the teacher teaching for like hours and helf in sonthing that students need. in effect, some students do not have capacity to make the classes from home, they needing to make the classes in the school to learn more. students did not have the same opcion like others students like the time or the learning. for example, most of them have a job and they not have the time to take the classes from home, because they lose the time in the job and when they going to the home they are tired and only going to sleep. while, the others students improve their life in the schools the others students who make the classes onlone not learn enything because they not have time. make the classes from home it is not necesary for students because they can going to school every day and work after school and with this method they have more chance to improve they learning. truly, the school give the option but the students have the choice. in conclutiong, they not learn in the classes from home that in the school, and this can be affect tehir learning. they teaching themself because in home tehy do not have a teacher to helf them. they not have same opportinity like others",2.5,3.0,2.5,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.745474100112915,2.6841745376586914,2.723525285720825,2.831921100616455,2.642367124557495,2.705657720565796
"i remember one summer vacation, that my family and i took, where we went to another state to visit another relative that we haven t seen in awhile. summer vacation had been the same for many years, summer vacation is when teenagers take a break from school to enjoy what they like to do during their free time. by having a long summer vacation, does not affect students to retain information from the past. teens should know that summer vacation is when they can enjoy their break to do what they want for fun. first reason, why teens should know that summer vacation is for them to enjoy, is because they can spend time with their family. for example, the whole family can got to another state to visit another relatives that they have not seen in awhile. by spending more time with their family; consequently, teens can be more closer to their family. teens can also, enjoy their summer vacation with their family by playing video games, watching movies, and go on a road trip. another reason, why teens should know that summer vacation is for them to enjoy, is that they can hangout with friends. teenagers hangs out with friends to go to a party, or to watch a movie. by hanging out with friends teens can do what they think is fun for them and their friends. for example, teens can have a fun time playing pool with their friends or just by going to a gym. in addition, teens can also have fun with their friends by having a sleep over or go for a camping trip. lastly, on why students should know that summer vacation, is for them to enjoy, is that they are away from school, by being away from school students can have more time to have fun and do the things that are important to them. for example, students can stay up late and does not have to wake up early in the morning. however, teens can have more time in their hands, instead of having to learn. in conclusion, these are the three most important opinions, on why teens should know that their summer is for them to enjoy, by having more time for summer vacation, teens can enjoy more time with their family and friends.",3.5,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.8103249073028564,3.9204859733581543,3.8481876850128174,3.9346587657928467,3.8617589473724365,3.8295648097991943
"opportunity to graduate early some school districts offer programs that allow high school students to graduate in three years instead of the traditional four years. the programs include some activities that can be complete during the three years, taking place in summer or after school. student also cannot take elective classes, they need to take the necessaries to be able to graduate with all the requirements. this programs give a lot of opportunities for students. this is a good idea for student to finish high school in three and enter to college or the work force one year early because they will be able to be educate younger and earn time. students have a lot of labor opportunities in jobs if they are able to finish their education early and being younger. for example, to work in a company; normally the company employer wants to have young employees, but at the same time, employees with experience. if students finished early they education they can begin to work earning experience and skills. having a positive result for their capacities and opportunities for be selected or contract to the jobs. also young people have more physical resistance than elder people, in this way they can permanence working more time and harder. this kind of opportunities are benefits for their future employments. earn time it is important for every person and more important for students. for example, they can accomplish college early. if student finish high school in three years they can begin go to college one year early. in this way they can begin their preparation for the career they choose to study and finish it to be a person educate and have a stable employment. save and earn time forming part of this programs help the students to have a better future with a good education. there is a lot of people that are disagree about the programs that allow high school student to graduate in three years. some points of view of this people are that student should have fun in summer instead to go to school. also they say that student should not stay after school, they should take advantage of their time to focus on other activities or working. however, student should be allow to form part of this programs because it is give beneficial opportunities for their education. benefits in jobs and ingress early to college. there are some school programs that give students the change to graduate in three years and not in the normal four years. students should use this programs because it is have a lot of beneficial possibilities to take advance. advance to finish their education younger to have better opportunities in jobs. advance to earn time, finish their education, and have a career early. be part of this programs is the best idea for students that want to improve them self.",4.0,3.5,4.0,3.5,4.0,4.0,3.484309196472168,3.2020621299743652,3.214813232421875,3.4214863777160645,3.088265895843506,3.218794822692871
"the one thing i hope i accomplish is to get a high paying job. i would want a high paying job since it could pay off many things that i don t need to pay later. my reasons is to travel to many places i ve never been to, buy many things as i want without spending my family money s, and i would try many different foods that could be expensive. one reason why my accomplishment is getting a high paying job is to travel around the world or place that i never been to. traveling around the world could be really expansive since your going to buy many things you would need or don t need. sometimes traveling depends on where you are going since some places are cheap or expansive. having a lot of a good amount while traveling is a good because you could do anything you want with that money while your not at home. i think having a high paying job is good for traveling is not always cheap, you can buy anything you ve ever wanted and not worrying much about using to much money. the next reason is to buy many things as i want without spending any or some of my parents or family members money. this is important because it wouldn t matter much if you used you own money but if you use your family money you might have to pay them back later on. another reason is going out when you want to and you dont really want to spend your family money because you need a lot since you could be going to many places. when you want to take your family out to a really nice place or a place where you think they would enjoy or relax, you can just surprise them by already getting it done and paid off. another reason it is a good idea to get a high paying job, to not spend your family money. the last reason is trying many different foods that could be expansive. from my experiences i know that most places has really expansive food that is really good. i also know that going to a super fancy restaurant is expansive since all the foods could be really good or just a rip off. sometimes going to really fun places or vacations foods are expansive because it could taste good and many people would might want to try some, also if it was cheap many people would ve gone crazy. paying for good expansive food is worth it then paying too much for something that taste bad. in conclusion that a high paying job is good for traveling to places you ve never been to, spending lots of money without using your families money, and eating or buying really expansive foods. going to places you have never been to is great. spending our own money lets us buy anything we want. also buying or trying new foods is really nice when you can buy it. this is why i",3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.6981072425842285,3.68162202835083,3.8352699279785156,3.828277587890625,3.6739728450775146,3.738938093185425
"adding another hour and thirty minutes to the school schedule is just a waste of time! it means having to miss time with my family. it also means having to wake up earlier to get to school. teachers would have to stay back and work longer but probably get paid the same amount for ten hours. so i disagree with having to add another hour and thirty minutes. first of all i don t think kids would like to wake up extra early and get ready for school. once the students get to the school they would be half asleep and it would be harder for them to focus. the students would have trouble staying awake and they would have more attitude then what they have now. more students would be marked tardy and there would more students skipping classes just to get some sleep. not every student would stay awake through out the day and finish there work. adding an hour and thirty minutes would also have an impact on teachers. they already have to wake up extra early in order to be here on time and stay late to work on grading papers, going to meetings, etc. it would be harder for them to stay awake and teach. teachers don t even get paid enough. so why would they want to stay back and serve more time. some after school activities would get canceled and student that would need those after school activities would get mad. complaints would start coming in and parents would get mad and ask why their child is failing. some sports would be canceled and and athletes would get frustrated because they won t be motivated or asked to go to a certain collage. students would get low grades if after school activities were to get canceled. the school would become a laughing stock. adding an hour and thirty minutes would have a bad effect on the school and the people in it. there would be more trouble then there is now and students wouldn t get motivated. grade levels would go down and students won t focus. teachers would have trouble staying up for ten hours. family time would be shortened as well.",4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,3.5,3.8809430599212646,3.8684470653533936,3.868191957473755,4.101163864135742,3.9146764278411865,4.035526275634766
"i don t think that school districts should allow students to graduate early. i believe that this is a bad idea because students have to take more classes than what you usually take, students would have to stay after school or maybe even take summer school, so they can get enough credits to graduate early, and students would be very stressed having to learn all this material for each of their classes, since they won t be taking any electives. for these reasons, i don t think school districts should allow students to graduate early. students who are graduating early, will have to take extra classes during the school year, so that they can earn the credits for their classes. in many schools, you have to have at least four credits in one subject, so that means the student will most likely have to take two classes of one subject to earn the credits for that one specific subject. some students graduating early, might have a difficult time being all caught up in each of their classes, which can lead to them having to stay after school to take tutoring classes in case they don t understand the material being taught. most students, will either have to take school during the summer or they stay after school to take extra classes. students who stay after or do summer school do this, so that they can earn all the credits they need to graduate early. students who choose to do summer school don t have to take that many classes when they go back to school, since they already took some classes during the summer. students who choose to stay after school to take extra classes, will have to stay in school longer, so they can learn all the material for the subjects that they are taking after school. students will be stressed and under pressure when it comes to learning and studying for each of their classes. they will be stressed because they re going to have to study for a lot of their classes, when they take tests and sometimes they can have tests in multiple classes on the same day, which means they are going to have to study for multiple classes. same thing applies with homework, they will feel under pressure to get all their work done. they wouldn t be taking any electives, so that means all their classes will be hard, since elective classes are usually easy. this is why i think that graduating early is a bad idea, because students will be very tired and stressed trying to catch up on school work. if you do four years of high school instead of three years, everything will go a lot slower than three years and also you will be less stressed, when it comes to catching up on school because you will have less classes to worry about. this is why it s better to do four years of high school.",4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,3.867879629135132,3.779632091522217,3.942255973815918,4.085705280303955,3.8214221000671387,3.8720920085906982

"generic_name thinks the school should control students involvement in extracurricular activities. students are in extracurricular activities to enrich their educational experiences. some people think schools should control student involvement in extracurricular activities because they would know if the students grades are good enough to enroll in a activity or more. other people think students and families have the decision to pick whether students should be involved in a extracurricular activities because the school can t force you do a sport you dont want to do and they can t push away your dreams of playing a sport. generic_name thinks schools need to control students involvements in the extracurricular activities because not a lot of parents care if they children have time for extra assignments or they don t care if their kids stay out late to participate in any activity related to school. first of all, people think schools should decide students involvement in activities. some students want to play many sports but not all of them will have time to complete homework assignments or study fr any quizzes and tests. for example generic_name s older sister use to play two sports. one was related to school and the other one was outside of school. she never had time to do her homework so her grade was going down. she also had to study for her tests but she didn t have time since she was practicing her sport too much and so she failed the grade. secondly, other people think students and families have the decision to pick whether students should be involved in activities. an example is generic_name s friend wouldn t want the school to not let him play the sport he always been wanting to play. generic_name s friend thinks it wouldn t be fair to force him to play a sport he doesn t like. generic_name, generic_name s friend would like to play a sport to distract his mind if he is stressing or is having depression. generic_name also wants to have the choice to pick any sport he would like to play but also wants to finish his work in class or study his tests during lunch or before school so he doesn t fail. lastly, the majority of people think schools need to control students involvement in activities because not a lot of parents care if their children have time for assignments or to study for tests. in general parents don t care about their kids schools or grades so they won t worry if their kids are out late for any sport. one example, generic_name s aunt don t care about his cousin generic_name so she is always out late. generic_name wants to try a sport in school so she can get a scholarship to go to college since her parents don t care about her but she wants to be someone in life and do better things. she wants to decide on her own if she should join a sport or not. i think the school should control the students involvement in sports.",2.5,3.0,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.5348000526428223,3.3758108615875244,3.4797005653381348,3.5641961097717285,3.3130648136138916,3.4794206619262695

some schools have programs that older kids can help younger kids. if they don t know how to somethings in school or out side of school. or they are there just there to assist other kids that more help then other kids this can be helpful. for older kids that they might have to teach something new that they did not know or just teach something that they had some hard time in when they where leaning this in school. and can be more helpful for younger kids because they might have to work a little more harder and get more. challenged more then they get at home or school and they get through there homework at this after. school program and then when they get back to school they have there homework done and then there homework. might not be late or they might just be more on top of there stuff and when they get home they just can relax and play some games or just go outside. and have good jobs later in there lives and i think that more kids should have this. chance to get this time to study and get better programs in there school. because we have good programs and then if most of every school have likes programs they can get help by older students and younger students can help they older can help by helping the younger and the younger if they are not doing homework and if they are done with home work they can help other younger students. so they can get the help and the assisting that need or might need because if you are good with some like math but then the homework gets harder they might just need just need some more time or more time study and going over there past home work to see if he can or she can solve that problems or if they can t that why there are the older student. that can them help he or she with the home work or projects. they can help one and other to finish faster and get their projects done if they wish to or they can just work on it just by them self. and then when most of the kids are done with homework witch most won t be they might go on there computers or they can go outside and play some outside games witch so half would go out side and the other will stay to keep this program fun and not just doing homework and classwork all day long. so they can keep or gain some energy to when they are done form playing they can comeback inside with some. energy and not being broad all the time there are there. at the after school programs.,2.0,2.0,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.8646411895751953,2.6593663692474365,2.699226140975952,2.8911736011505127,2.5971109867095947,2.734187602996826

"i would disagree for adding a one hour and a half hour because maybe parents might be worried about their child or children at school for another hour or two. i would say why would students want another hour of school if they just want to go home and see their family. i would even say that i would not want another hour of school cause isn t seven hours of school enough already. i can understand if teachers want to see their students even more maybe but maybe they have to email their students parents before having to get the extra hour of school. what i would say is that all the students should vote online or in public to see if they all want to have a extra hour or half a hour still because it can`t be the parents only because it`s not fair for the adults to decide if they have to get another hour or two the students have to decide because they are the ones that are gonna have the extra hour. i understand that kids might want to do activities for their school or they can stay after school to do it like, assignments,homework,projects,powerpoints,tests,and quizzes. i usually would`nt want to have another because it`s complicated sometimes doing stuff there and it is just to much for me to handle at one time mostly and i have to do a lot stuff at home also so i rather not have another hour of school cause it`s a lot. if he or she doesnt want to stay they dont have to vote or say anything but other people might say something if they do want to have the extra hour or two i would speak up for himself or herself cause if u do want the extra hour or two go ahead vote or speak up for yourself and do your best to change the idea of the story or idea of the other people that would not have the extra hour. now back to my disagreement about having another hour of school i would not have another hour of school because it is it much work for me to handle mostly cause the amount of work i have to do at school is so ridiculous really ridiculous cause the person or me has to write alot form time time and its worth it cause your getting a free education but i dont want alot of education i would want to stay me and me only.",3.0,3.5,3.0,3.5,4.0,3.0,3.4579169750213623,3.1059916019439697,3.0922598838806152,3.4094364643096924,3.121454954147339,3.1804134845733643

"do you accomplish more when you always keep yourself busy? in this essay i will argue that keeping yourself busy serves a purpose. you get more things done, you will not be considered lazy and you get to learn new things. when you are always doing something you get more things done and out of the way. you will not be behind on anything. this is a good habit to have because it can affect you in the long run. for example, when you get older and have to pay taxes or bills. you will be caught up and on time which is really good for your credit score. you will not be considered lazy. many people in your life will notice how you like to get things done. this habit will definitely get you a job. no employer is looking for someone lazy and does not like to do things. keeping yourself busy can be therapeutic. many people do this to relive stress or think about things instead of being useless. you will learn new things. take advantage of the things you do because it can lead you to new opportunities. you can experience different things which is phenomenal. it is always fun keeping yourself busy because you feel great after the things you have accomplished. the more things you learn the more things you can try to keep yourself busy. some people say inactivity serves a purpose, but they are wrong because when you are always doing something it keeps you motivated, experienced and makes a good habit to have. in the future i hope we have less useless people and more people who like to get things done.",4.0,4.0,4.5,4.0,3.5,4.0,3.832085371017456,3.878244638442993,3.8401026725769043,4.071220874786377,3.7881269454956055,3.9437754154205322
"i am writing this prompt to inform you about the position for hiring. i would be very delighted if i could be hired by you. i do not have experience at all but, i can show you that i am a good candidate for this job and i could handle the job very well. here are some few reason why i would be a good candidate for the job. one reason on why you should hire me is that even though i don t have experience i tend to learn really fast and do multiple things at a time. usually i memorize them very easily. it has a greater impact on me because i learn fast and customers are more happy with the service. also, i could do many things at a time which is good for the job and good for the customers. for example, in some restaurants it takes long for someone to do your order or even get to your table to get your order. it is better if you have someone that is fast and shows that the customers are there number one priority. it is good that the customers feel welcomed and feel important when the workers are giving them attention. another reason is that i have an amazing, outstanding attitude with people. i am a very joyful person and what i feel like is right, is giving joyfulness to customers who need it. for example, i have friends that sometimes have had a rough day and i tend to help them and make them happier and change their perspective to a better one. i think it is good that if a restaurant has someone happy and joyful the customers would want to come in because its a very joyful place. my goal is always to see poeple smiling and keept encouraging them to always be happy. the restaurant can always make more money when customers feel like its there home. lastly, i like meeting new people at jobs and working as a group. what i love to do is bringing everyone together and making new friendships. i ve seen that when working as a groups it is better because you get things done faster. you also make greter connections with your coworkers. for example, if someone needs something for a customer and your busy doing something else its better to ask a coworker to help you out. i like bringing bonds together and working with them. these are some of the reason i would love to get the job. i want to learn something new thats not from my perspective. i love trying new things and getting to know the different types of jobs around the community. i also learn very fast and i love being commited to anything and working as a group. i hoppe you consider me to work there and i would be very happy. thank you for your time.",3.0,3.0,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.8577864170074463,3.9047627449035645,3.930701494216919,4.0608930587768555,3.913831949234009,3.948612689971924
"i believe high schools students should not be expected to stick to a career, they are barely finding themselves. choising a career a at young age can lead to mistakes like choosing something you don t enjoy. high schools program shoud be a way to help the future profesional to find what they are really want to be in the future, high school stage is one of the most important step for the young age students, because there is when they choose their future, we need to work with them the best way is posible, we need to find out a programs that impulse them to continue students after high schools graduate. in some case parents try to tell their children what career they have to take, in that case if the students have to choose a career by the time they are entering to the high schools, most probably will be their parents choosed what career they are going to take it, so that may be a mistake for the student because when they finally found themself, probably they realize there were something else more interesting for them that they could take it, at that time would be too late. also some students may take a career that doesn t make the money they were expecting, or choosing a career that s not fit for them, what the high school should be concern about is to form the best profesional for the future, teaching them the best educations is posible and the same way showing them what kinds of career are there,the advantage and the disadvantage all the career have it. high schools programs should know they re playing a really impotant roll in the future of the country, however the programs needs to be concentrated, should be educated the young guys the best way is posible, create a programs to keep them away from problems like; grugs, alcohols, gangs. this problems are killing our new genetion, this is one of the reason why the students leave the schools at early time. also the high schools needs to help the students to find the career that will make them be happy in the furute. should not be the high schools expected to the students to identify a career before or at the time their are entering to the high schools. in conclusion, high schools students, in my opinion are not ready to choose a career yet, at their age they may not know what really want, or be ready to make such a big decision.",3.0,2.0,2.0,2.5,2.0,2.0,3.1852056980133057,3.020796775817871,3.0039830207824707,3.15153431892395,2.9444427490234375,2.9473459720611572
"generic_name pd. sol / / ""commit a career at a young age gives time for students to approach their goals and advance towards the future"" during high school, many juniors and seniors are already preparing themselves for college, taking classes that would give them credit and would benefit them as they go, also there are some classes that would provide students lots of experiences, these experiences prepared students in a way for them to see how much effort they must put to approach their goal. the board of teachers in a private school have said that, ""the more early a student starts their way to a career, the less struggle is for them to accomplish it"", because at their young age they have more time, less worries and not that much of responsibility, as a person gets older the more problems and responsibilities come to them, although students also have many struggles in school, their house etc, is more less then an adult, that is why teachers think that is better for a student to commit a career at a young age because they are less worried. the percentage of students that commit a career at a young age is high, many of this students received a schoolarships others financial help, because of their behavior and their effort,the other half of this percentage of students have a well financial situation and there is no need for help or schoolarships, although there is a low percentage of students that prefer to work instead of going to college, because of their financial situation,however many students with low financial situation have succeed at their young age because of their effort to accomplish their dreams by working hard and knowing what they want to succeed in. commiting a career at a young age could be difficult or it could be simple, there is more students that had said that is a great idea, because your mind at a young age is envolving in everything that surrounds the student, such as important information that would benefit him, as i said, the brain has more potencial to store as much information as it can, because the student is young and is focus on its goals and there is no problems or thoughts that could disstract the student. other students had said that is a bad idea in a way of making the biggest decisition, which is choosing what career you want to accomplish, because at that age they do not actually know what they really want. parents and the societies have a big influence when students are choosing which path to go, some parents wants their kids to follow their steps, so they encorage their kids to take courses that would help them as they go, parents would always want the best for their kids more when its about their future. accomplishing a career at a young age brings many benefits, one of them is that the person not longer have to be thinking about it, takes a big weight off their shoulders, also the person would have",3.0,3.0,3.5,3.0,3.0,2.5,3.6837942600250244,3.797433376312256,3.814605712890625,3.947850465774536,3.69930100440979,3.6684165000915527

"benefits of working in a group is much easier than working all by yourself. for example, working with a group can help the students communicate with their classmates. they can also get a lot of work done by working in groups. working with groups is such a good idea because the classmates can communicate with each other , take the stress away from working alone. for example i have a lot of teachers who like to assign assignments independently and group work. it s a hassle for me to work on my own because i have a busy schedule after school. at times i dont even get to turn in my assignment when it s due. when my teacher assigns group it s way easier for me because all of my classmates will get to get a job to do with the assignment and we can work on it at school and be finished before the due date. it s also nice to go out of your confront zone and make new friends while working on assignments and an easy a. being in groups knowledge you to understand better by your classmate. example one day in history we had a project to do as a group and i was completely lost on the civil war. i had to ask my classmates questions if they can help me so i can understand better and get to do the work. sometimes teachers doesn t know how to be specific so it gets hard to understand. seeking help from a classmate that s in your group is a good thing to do and you learn more and becomes more understandable. not a lot of students like to work in groups because their scared they have to do the work , however; if you communicate with your classmate and assign a job it will go easy on them and get the work done quicker and easier. in conclusion , working with groups it s more beneficial instead of cramping in the work and not get it done.",3.5,4.0,3.5,4.0,3.5,4.0,3.711568832397461,3.770928144454956,3.735884666442871,4.050656318664551,3.7079269886016846,3.843863010406494
"in some societies, some students are expected to identify a career by the time they enter high school. the courses of study in high school are selected to guide them toward a specific career. it would be amazing if students start when they enter high school. it is a good idea for students to commit to a career at a young age? students should be commit to a career at a young age because it helps students to develop more and it allows a lot of opportunity for many students. first, start a career at a young age it s important for students because it would helps to develop more. for example, sometimes students choose to do other stuff instead do work. some students really want to success and get everything in life. students would always like to have good future over everything. if students commit to a career at a young age, they would be develop in different ways. for example, students would have more stuff to do, more homework. their mind would be thinking about stuff for their careers. they going to take things more serious for their life. secondly, start a career at a young age it s important for students because it allows a lot of opportunity. for example, generic_name was a student from generic_school, she choose to start commit to a career when she was years old. it was hard for her because she took a lot of extra classes. but, she planned to get better lifestyle. she work really hard to complete what she want. by, generic_name start a career at a young age was the best option she did in her life, she have a lot of opportunity, she can work wherever she want to. thus, start thing at a young age students would success more. however, some people may argue that students should not be commit to a career at a young age because students would not enjoy high school. for example, people argue that students would be more incline about their career, and the would not enjoy high school as a teenager. however, start at a young age would be benefit for students because they would take high school as serious part of life. also, students would have more opportunity in life, and they would develop more as a person. to conclude, people would always say that students should no be start a career at a young age. but start at a young age would be the best choice for students in life. students have the opportunity to be more successful in their careers. sometimes would be hard for them to do double work, but as they focus and work hard, they would complete a lot in life. start things at a young age always have good benefits for students and people in general.",3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,3.19622802734375,2.9055864810943604,2.884726047515869,3.1569278240203857,2.9199650287628174,2.9931468963623047

"i have being asked to explain the effects of a program involving pairing, older students , and younger students. some schools have a program that pairs older students and younger students. i think that a program like that will be helpful. the older students are available to assist the younger students. this program can be helpful, to both the older and the younger students, because both the younger and older students, can learn new things from their opponent, or classmate. also is fair that the older students assist, the younger students, so both of them can be sucessful. like maybe the younger students can teach the older students, some new skills the ve learned in school, or somewhere else. or maybe how they ve learned to play baseball or softball. the older students can teach the younger students, how to do algebra / solving equations or how to ride a bike. helping out younger students helping order students can be fun and can also turn out to be great. or sometimes bad. like for example, in my school, they have a club that both younger and older students can be in. it is free and not obligatory. so me and some of my friends, joined that club. and also some othe r students. some of the older students, helped us, if we needed help, and we also helped them if they needed help. every time during that club we each bring our own snacks or the teacher gives us some snacks himself, and we get to work. that club at school was so helpful for me and my friends, because we can get our homework done in time, and some older students or adults assist us if we need help. me and my friends also enjoyed that club because it was fun at certain time. in conclusion, pairing older students , with younger students, can be very helpful to certain people in need. being kind an cooperating is the best thing to do while being in a club or working with younger and older students.",4.0,3.5,4.0,3.5,4.0,3.5,3.523099660873413,3.429319143295288,3.2684614658355713,3.337156295776367,3.349384307861328,3.4221057891845703

"why are people scared to fail? is failing really a bad thing. no! for example churhcill says that ""success consists of going from failiure to faliure without loss of enthusiasm"". i agree with him. i believe that to have success in life you have to go through failiure. failing with the same feelings and mindset is hard but you just have to think failing is a way of getting better. failiure is also not something you should be afraid of or embarressed of. you should be proud of failing cuz you know what you did wrong and next time make it twice as strong. failing does not mean that your to dumb to do whatever it is. it just means you need some more time. churchill bleieves that failure has an important role in the pursuit of success. which i also believe this becuase once you fall all you want to do is get right back up. which i encourage everyone to do. when you fall get back up everyone falls. life is about taking risks and failing. which in my opinion evryone should do. failiure is the key to success. without failing you can t really call it success. i beleive you can only succeed in something that you have failed at. without failing life would be boring and everything would be the same because people are taking riks we have lots of different things in the world today. everyone has failed to do something. not everyone in the world is perfect. i wrote this to persuade my readers to take risks. it is also fine to fail just get up and try again. surely, if churchill was a live today her would be spreading the same message around the world. that without failiure there is no success. also, that everyone has failed at something, nobodies perfect. churchill is trying to say that faliure turns in to success. once you fail you know what you have to do to get yourself back up. then you try again and again until you get something you are happy with. this is what makes you try again. this is what makes you find and fix your problems. you get a lot out of failing thats why i think that anyone that is going through something tough don t give up so easily becuase its is ok to fail. failing is a good thing not a bad. however, its hard for people to think in this way becuase they think once they fail its all over. its not over until you want it to be over. keep trying and try your hardest.",3.0,2.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.5,3.32743501663208,3.21692156791687,3.2456421852111816,3.305516004562378,3.1697676181793213,3.196734666824341

"do i agree that my school should follow this model by extending the school day two hours? some of this businesses have adopted a four-day work week, without thinking about the consequences. each day consisting of ten hours to conserve energy and resources which it would be difficult for them since they will be working ten hours per day during four days of week. taking the model of the businesses expending school day to conserve energy and resources, with each day consisting of two hours will be a difficult choose to make. first of all the government need to be part of this decision, and need to be include to see which are the consequences going to be in taking this choose. personally i am fully disagreement with this model, but not only myself is in disagreement there is a lots of people that believe school should not follow this model to conserve energy and resources by expending the school day two hours. the government and society is the one who s need to be taking control of this decision, because they know what is good for the students and what is bad for them. in a society it is unlike the average american work week, so it would be difficult for families to adopt to the changes. having longer school days and shorter weeks does not align with the structure of a typical parent s work schedule. most students being involved in extracurricular activities after school, and not being able to drive, the four day school week will create many conflicts. parents will most likely struggle to get their children to those activities and anything involving life outside of school. most parents would have to adjust their work schedules to accommodate for the new school hours. also, an extra day off for students but not necessarily for parents and child care would be required for the younger students on the extra day off. additional expenses such as that are not always easy for families to come up with. lots of changes would be put into action. some others believe that the positives of changing to a four-day work week outweigh the inconveniences brought on by extending the day. their main rational revolves around improving to transportation, building and it will be good for students to be able to have more down time. taking part of this i would argue that the benefits seen so shortage, like a lack in the amount needed. in real world application of this plan applied in a education settings does not posses the same bonuses. the advantage of having another day off most likely friday, while promising, does not necessarily means a day without work to do. in fact, there is a lot of many ways that you can conserve energy and resources, some business adopt different ways to conserve energy and many resources. although i do not like this plan that our school should fallow this model (their plan is so bad), if we start doing this plan we will be in a several problem.",3.5,2.5,3.0,3.5,2.5,3.0,3.7930145263671875,3.890002727508545,3.9488320350646973,3.889749526977539,4.101699352264404,3.9888789653778076
"success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm i think is a good idea because, you can be a successful person, you need believe in yourself, and you need support of your family. you can be a successful person, because you can do all the things that you have in mind, and you can realize more than you already have, for example once my friend generic_name told me that her cousin generic_name he loves fix computers, but he only can fix computers he can not fix telephones, tv, refrigerators and another electronics devices and he always was sad because his goal was that he can fix all the electronic devices, he join in a group of people that fix electronic devices, he always cry because he did not understand the things that he was learn, he always was try day to day, so one day he was the winner in the competition of who was the person that fixed one tv in the less time as possible, he fixed the tv in minute, other people fixed in or minutes, finally he earn a diploma of the best fixed person, after years he learn that nothing was impossible for him , in the actuality he has a store that he sell and fix electronic devices. the experience of generic_name is a good example in our life because he learn that never give up, he always fight for his goals and that example we can do exactly the same that generic_name always fight for our goals and always try another new things that we think that we can not do. also the reason that you need believe in yourself is that you always need be positive person, every day see what are the things that you need for have success or what you need to do every day. in my experience i was in th grade was my first day of school at generic_school,i never was with a lot of nervous, and i did not speak english ,so all my classes in my first day of school i feel many eyes on my because i was the new student, then at the end of my day i take my correct bus and when i was at home talking with my mom i told her that i do not like the school because was different of my schools on my country and my mom told me that with the pass of the days i will feeling a good person, a correct person. so in my first year in the school i get all my classes with a at the end of my first year i earn one diploma in math and four diplomas for each end of the quarter, so i pass th grade with excellent grades too, but sometimes i fail my classes my test in algebra i fail many of the test or sometimes i get d or f in my classes and when i fail something is when i was think that i am not good in my",2.5,3.5,3.0,2.5,3.0,2.5,2.8113532066345215,2.6665310859680176,2.611405611038208,2.8487722873687744,2.673736095428467,2.672322988510132

"last year, a student in my classroom was caught using his cellphone during class. he pointed out that the reasoning behind it was that he was searching something that involved the class, but the teacher still took up his phone. by allowing the use of cellphones in class many students would get even more distracted than they already are. it would also be easier to cheat and get good grades, since all the information would be of easy access. on the other hand, this would make the technological integration in school even better and easier, something that many dream and believe will happen in the close future. i believe cellular devices should not be allowed during educational time. initially, cellphones would draw too much of student s attention. teenagers spend enough time of their day staring at screens, and school should be a place where that doesn t happen. many are addicted to social media, and have the ""need"" to check it every minutes. sometimes when i am in class and decide to take out my phone, not looking and paying to the teacher for more than a minute makes me loose focus of class and need to ask the ones around me for help. class is a place where students should focus and pay attention, by allowing the use of phones many would get distracted and use it for non-educational purposes which would make learning harder, since this focus should be used on what the teacher is saying instead of what their friends are posting online. secondly, it would be an encouragement to cheating. with the integration of cellphones in class students would start getting better grades, since many of them would simply google all of the answers for a worksheet instead of paying attention to the class and answering it based on what they ve learned. this would make so that daily grades get better, but when test day arrives, the student who googled every answer in the past week would get a bad grade because he didn t really learn anything, all his answers were based on someone or something helping him. this would then encourage cheating, because that student would most likely realize that with the use of his cellphone daily grades were getting better, but when it came down to not using the device his grades would drop. however, it could be helpful and very easy to set up. with limitations in place, like blocking certain apps and websites that have nothing to do with school, cellphones could be useful during educational time. technology integration in schools is already happening, many give chrome books to students so they can use it during class, but these are expensive and getting one for every student is not always viable. everyone has a cellphone so there would be no need for extra devices ,since phones have different uses, including many that could be of help during educational time. the student from my classroom which was caught using his cellphone still uses it during class, he is barely passing that class",4.0,4.0,5.0,4.5,5.0,5.0,3.88993501663208,4.243659973144531,4.26104736328125,4.12822151184082,4.240485668182373,4.503957748413086

"some schools are offering distance learning for students to attend class from home. with online or video conferencing . i support thus idea of distance classes because you can wake up anytime you want, go in a slow speed to no overwhelm yourself, no one can bother you while you study. first of you can wake up anytime you want so you can have the right amount of hours in case you work at night and you dont get seven to nine hours of sleep every night. also you can do classes later in the day in case you want to work in the morning instead of the night. so you can have a career and have time to study to make your future come closer. it s also a good thing for people that have to stay home to look at after their sick parents or little brothers they won t have to worry at school if they are okay because they will be home taking classes and making sure everything is okay while studying. therefore they won t be overwhelmed about missing days or which classes he needs to make up a test or if he/she has a project coming up in class because all of that info is going to be in his/her phone or laptop. its a better thing to have online classes doesn t take up half of your day you dont get overwhelmed with new info for like different classes in one day. so you wont be stressed out as much that (study shows most kids that drop out is because they are being stressed out with so many info in just one day for like different blocks in a single day). online classes are better from what i heard it help s you better cause it teaches you what the state want s you to know instead of things you dont need to know like some side stories that teachers say to make you try to remember but end up getting lost in the story. finally when you do your work no one can bother you about the answer or what problem you in and they cant cheat off of you and you end up getting in trouble because they didnt stop asking or taking to you. its also a good thing because if you don t understand you can go back a lesson to relearn it again in case you forgot how to do the problem. thats why online classes are more proffered then actual class when you have to wake up early and go to school all tired cause you only slept a little staying up because of work or studding for the next unit so you cant fall behind or re doing a new untie while going into a new one. so i support the idea of distance learning for students and that schools are thinking about doing it would be a great idea.",3.5,3.0,3.0,3.5,4.0,3.0,3.506737232208252,3.1596176624298096,3.27990984916687,3.4309322834014893,3.1120235919952393,3.258359670639038
"one activity i consider really enjoyable are science experiments . one of the reasons i consider these activities fun is because they are different from other types of projects . and what i mean by this is that for example when one does a math project or a language arts project is nothing more then doing many math exercises or writing an essay . unlike the science projects for example one time i got to see a frog s interior . and it might sound desgusting to many of the people reading this and to be honest it did nt smell good either . but one of the things that facinated me from the project it was that frogs dont have as many organs as we human s do . or maybe they removed some of them but there wasn t a lot of organs in there and another thing i was curious about was that they were different colors . i remember seeing blue and pink unlike us humans almost all of our insides are red . frogs actually got different colors in their interior but they looked a little dry because my teacher told me that they have been frozen for some time . but it defenently made it easier to cut parts in the interior of the frog . and also sense my teacher told me that we were able to cut whatever we wanted me and my group tried to explore as much as possible . but there was a part that was really desgusting which was that there was some flies in the frog s stomach . and that part definently disgusted me but it didn t made me want to stop either. after we finished trying to see everything inside the frog the teacher told us the name and function of each of the parts of the frog . but one of my friend decided it was silly to poke the frog s eye . and until this point i still dont know what went trough his mind in that exact moment . but wen he poke it , it resulted that the frog s eye was nt completly frozen so liquid from the eye just came rushing out and he got wet because he decided to do that . fortunently it did nt reach me but it defenently reach my mate . after that the teacher send him to the bathroom to wash himself . after that happened my teacher decided that it was best to just stop the project after that . but it was defenently a lot of fun . another example of a project was recently when my tacher decided to have us do a project in the dark because is themed to what we are learning about right now . which is the unit of light and the project was really simple and to be honest it wasn t as amazing and funny as the other project . but it was to spray a liquid in front a flashlight . and",3.0,2.5,3.0,3.0,2.5,3.0,3.168914556503296,3.0461599826812744,3.1079299449920654,3.1476292610168457,2.944000482559204,3.005704879760742

"do you think it is a good idea for the students to commit to a career at youg age? that is a good idea because the school will give the opportunity to know more things. also, is a bad idea because some students have a lot of things to do after school, they have responsabilities example; they have to work, they have to do things in their house, or many things what a young can do. i choose students have to take the career at a young age because: they will be ready when they have to work in that career, if they going to take the careers that they prefer it is going to be good, because they will practice and they will learn a lot in of that ,so they will focuse everyday in that career. the most important is they won t have any problems when they have to show everything what they learn after they did finish their career. it is a good idea because is not bad that in some societies the students has to expected to identify a career by the hight school, because about that form the people can know what is his/her specialty, or what work realized in the high school ,if that person was good or bad in that career. is good that person know what he/she wants to be in the future, because some people don t know what they want to be, what is their dreams when they become adult ,but some people know what they want to be ,and what is their dream job. is very important to know that you want to be sure about your future because this opportunities are not in every where we have to exploit the things the life give us, because when i was a little girl my dad alwas plead me that i enter a couses like english, computation,to play guitar, dance, and many things ,but i always respond no ,because i just wanted to play and that set , but now i know the importance to learn ,to know ,to make something ,and show to the world that you know that you can do that ,and nonthing in this world is impossible. they will have the capacity to learn more things about the careers what they will going to choose. also, the school will give them the opportunity to work in the summer or after school, this idea is amazing because in others countries like my country there are not career to choose in the schools ,the student are not ready or they are not ability to work in something because they don t practice nothing in the shool they don t know anything .they just study and don t have elective courses that ways, the student in my country don t work usualy the parent are who work. the conclution is that the students have to take some career ,bacause is very important for the societies also for them, they will be capacity to know many things. also, they will be",2.5,2.5,2.5,2.0,2.0,2.0,3.070105791091919,2.8283164501190186,2.9173696041107178,3.0034372806549072,2.802880048751831,2.865229606628418

"how does technology impact our life in a positive way? some people argue; that technology is creating a division between us. i believe the appropriate use of technology does not divide, or limit human contact. if we give a good use to it, we will have great benefits. besides, technology improves communication skills, helps parents, and facilitate jobs. research has proved that technology has been a useful tool for communication skills. this is shown in the facility that we have now at making a call, or video call to another country. it has improve communication for people who are speechless, defeat or just shy. all of them has problem at talking or listening, but with technology this is getting over. and they are interacting in certain way with other people. to sum up, technology is improving communication in different ways. parents always have many things to do. passing time with their children is not easy; however, technology is making easier it. now parents can work from home; this is giving them the opportunities to share more time in family. also, for parents that work out new machines are helping them to finish quickly. although, new phones schedule appointments and others for them, in order to be organize. in resume technology is giving the opportunities to spend time in family to parents. in centuries before how many time does a writer spend writing a book? technology has being a helpful tool for years; long time ago a writer spend one year writing a book by hand, now they just spend to months writing a book in a computer. new technology give us a lot of opportunities like: we do not work all days, we get a good pay, and we do not work in the sun shy. in resume, technology is facilitate our life. in conclusion, technology is a wonderful tool that let us develop our communication skills, unify families, and makes easier our jobs. people who does not have skill of listing or talking; they can still communicate their selves. families now are more unify. jobs now are more easy. i believe technology is having a good effect for those who use it appropiately.",4.0,4.0,3.5,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.653369665145874,3.3765249252319336,3.325730323791504,3.550159215927124,3.2428014278411865,3.3548576831817627
"i am agree with this idea because is the best opportunity not only to the hispanic people, well for everyone who want to follow his/her dreams, and has responsability or lower resources. i think is great idea, because some students sometime or usually work. one reason why the students do not go to the high school is because they do not have enough time to do homework, study, or just hey want to make more money. rarely students really want to learn, or to feel like they need to go to the college or university, cause they have a few time to go to the high school. this idea is great and amazing to someone really dream and feel that the high school is the door to the college, university, or opportunity to do your dreams real. the advantage is if you finish high school in three years you have more probability to go to the college or university. the disadvantage is that three years would be very stressing and harding time, because you need really to focus in the high school and all that stuff like: homework, worksheet, project, study, or simple attention the class. the good news is you can do anything if you have purpose, if you have motivation and completely focus in your dreams and what do you really want to be or to do?. do not worry is you feel fear that is normal everybody feel like that about the test, high school, or dreams. i think is a big opportunity to me; well, i work and really need pass my last year, but sometime feel like ""i cant anymore"", and i want to leave or run of the high school and just work, and work, and work, but everytime i think like that just say me "" never give up "", always remember everything i did, why am i here?,and how too far wil be go for my dreams?. sometime the life is very unjust, cause some people have the opportunity of study withouth work, while others people do not have chooses, and that is the situation where the hispanic people live today. well, that it s my point and why i am agree with this awesome idea. i have been thinking this system or program will be helpfull and better for every student that the system we have today. my view is if you finish the high school in three years, will be more effective, easy, and fast to be gratuated. thank you for your attention.",3.0,2.5,3.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,3.360126495361328,2.9798460006713867,3.0698275566101074,3.2779123783111572,3.028219223022461,3.0186164379119873

"i strongly agree with this statement that author ralph waldo emerson wrote because i can relate to it based on my passed experiences as a little kid not wanting to try new things in life like other food and activities. i did not like to try new things as a kid because when i would fail at them i would get mad or upset. but i ended up trying new things in life anyways and it helped change my mindset from not pushing myself to believing in myself that i could accomplish things and also help me grow as a person. for example when i was l lot younger then i am today like a lot of kids i did not like to try new food. i was that type of kid that just did not like to try new thing at all. say if i did not know what it was or had not try in before in the past i did not want it at all. some times my mom would tell me to eat my food or she would not let me go outside or take me to the park to play. so i would eat it but not because i wanted to it was because i wanted to go play outside or go to the park because i was just full of energy all the time and always liked to be outside. thinking back to those memories at least the ones that i can remember i always seem to get easily upset. when i did not know how to do something that other kids or people knew and could do. i would throw a fit you could say sometimes and not want to be a part of the activity at all and just straight up get mad over simplest things that just needed some time put towards them. so i could learn them or master them or someone that could have taught them to me. i think if i wouldnt have gave up on some things when i was younger i would have know how to do a lot more then i can today. instead of just watching the other people do this type of activities and enjoy themselves. i always wanted to know how to play these sports as a kid. like know how to play soccer,football,and play basketball. instead i would give up on myself on the first time i failed at it. but as time went by and the older i got little by little i started to try new things in life besides just other foods. i think the reason for this was that my mindset was changing and i did not give up on myself anymore i started to push myself to achieve my goals. i learn that anger would help me too like this one time in middle school i was in my math class my teacher said that i could not solve the problem that he had put on the board because i did not pay attention in class. so i",3.0,4.0,4.0,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.86352801322937,3.764364242553711,3.755953311920166,4.105056285858154,3.762011766433716,3.8912644386291504
i disagree that all students must participate in at least one extra curricular activity because students may have other plans or don t want to do an extra activity. students may have different plans for there future and want to work on what they want to do. some students want to focus on graduating school. it also may cause problems on most students. students want to do less work at a time. doing an extra activity may cause students to panic with a lot of work to do. another reason i disagree that all student must participate in at least one extra curricular activity because students may not like that there is a lot of activity they have to choose from. most students like to do things on there own or at home on there bed or personal space. many students don t like to do activity with other people around them and going with what the teacher wants them to do.,2.0,3.0,2.5,2.5,3.0,3.0,3.499262571334839,3.3319976329803467,3.2961323261260986,3.549227476119995,3.3803861141204834,3.3132615089416504
"today,we talk about the career for student at a young age. are the student need to commit to a career at a young age ? is it a good idea ? the answer is yes. they need to know what they want to do when they grow up. their course of study in high school will help them to choose what career they think they suppose to do. they have to focus to what career they choose and they gonna fathom out that career .example ,when a student want to be a doctor when he grow up that s why he have to focus to learn well biology and all about the doctor s job. if we don t show them what they need to do or like to do , they gonna lost outside the world . they don t know what career they need to follow and they are not going to have a good job. we gonna ruin their life indirectly. so that we should teach them about career and guide they to the right way . we love our student that s why we should support they to have a better life in the future. that s all of my opinion. i hope we don t make any mistake because everyone deserve a happy life. thank you all.",2.5,3.5,3.0,2.5,2.5,3.0,3.0188300609588623,2.850618362426758,2.810840606689453,2.941539764404297,2.7782094478607178,2.9884982109069824
"some people believe that they should seek guidance from experts and authorities about life important matters because some of they wants to do all the things perfect they don t wants to make a mistake. but i think that is not necessary to seek guidance from experts. the first reason that i think that is not necessary to seek guidance from experts it is that you can learn new things in your life doesn t matter if you make a mistake. the second reason that i think that the people should make their own decisions it is that a expert does know every thing about your life does know your feelings. as you can see my first reason that i think that it is not necessary to seek guidance from experts it is because people can learn new things in their life you can make a different in your life. doesn t matter if you make mistakes you not are a perfect person. every person learn about their mistake. do what ever you want. the people does know what is better for you every people thinks different to what you think. the second reason that i think that the people should make their own decisions it is because a expert does know every thing about your life. you can make your own decision. a expert can t choose what is better for and what it is not. also experts can be incorrectly to what is tell you to do. in conclusion, i think is more better to do your own things and do what you think is more better for you don t let people do the things for you. so, i believe that the people should make their own decisions. the reasons that i think that you should do your own decisions are . the first reason it is because you can learn new things and doesn t matter if you make mistake you can learn of yours mistakes. the second reason it is that a expert does know every thing about your life.",4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.5,3.5,2.8687894344329834,2.8343565464019775,2.817070722579956,2.8809523582458496,2.7785234451293945,2.847740888595581
"can you imagine someone that want to study more and to get more knowledge? well, many people do want to continue studying because the more knowledgeyou know, you will have a more benefits in your life. furthermore, like the author ralph waldo emerson wrote ""unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow."" he s because we never stop learning the little things in life such as: explore the world and to never stop your dream of continue your study. i agree with emerson s statement because we want to get in our goal in the survey and to never stop growing with mentality. first reason is that we have to explore the world. for example, by exploring the world we will know like the different cultures of each country or by having friends that are different country. like my mom always said ""you have to get out of the box to learn more, to see and explore what you have at your surroundings"". second, to never stop your dream of continue your study. for instance, if you want to grow mentally you have to study more to get the knowledge you want. the more knowledge you have, then the more great will be your job or even more better you can be your own boss. however, people will never grow if they don t continue their survey. finally as you can see, emerson s statement ""unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow"" is true because we will never stop learning, and the more you study the more knowledge you will know.",4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.5,3.5,3.5538337230682373,3.3860552310943604,3.2504899501800537,3.414005756378174,3.2687251567840576,3.3937149047851562
"i think this is benefiting being able to stay at home and do online classes sounds good. i agree because doing online class it goes on your own paste and you wont feel to rushed to finish, another good reason would be doing online is that you dont have to show up to school anymore so youll get to sleep in and wake up whenever. my final reason is if someone if decides to go to college they ll be ready because thats how college is online. think about not being able to have time to finish your work and your teacher saying you only have mins or by the end of class everything needs to be finished? well that wont have to be the case anymore because doing online means youll be going at your paste and you wont have to rush to turn things in. for example, i take an online class, so for me i already know how it works and honestly i think its way easier because no teacher is yelling at me to hurry about or i dont have to turn in incomplete work. so i like doing the online class is also fun because i be at home while doing my work in my bed. rough day at work, and you know you have school the next morning? well no worries because you get to sleep in and do you school work from your bed. thats right, dont have to wake up early and go to school. just chill at home in your bed and do your work. thats why i agree that we should have online classes because ill enjoy my bed and do my work from home. finally, last but not least college. if you ever plan to go to college then best believe that college is online class and video conferencing. nothing new go to the library and study from there who wouldnt like that.? in conclution online classses and video conferencing is the best way of learning. yes they benefit from learning and it helps them out.",3.5,2.5,3.0,2.5,3.5,3.0,3.48036527633667,3.235600471496582,3.270841360092163,3.402015447616577,3.2400496006011963,3.2872626781463623

"how much can we accomplish if we are always doing? thomas jefferson once wrote, ""determine never to be idle... it is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing."" i think he is right, if you think about it, the more you do, the more you will get and learn. over time, we ve seen how many people had accomplish their dreams and goals, because they were always trying and working hard for what they wanted and what they needed. if we are always working hard, we can achieved what we want and even more, i think that s what jefferson wanted to said with his words, the more you learn and do over your life, the more you will get, people will need you, and because they will need you, they would do whatever they can to get you. let me put you an example, think about your job, imagine you work in a restaurant, and you start as a cashier, and then you start to learn more, like you start to work in preparation, and then you put your hands in the kitchen, over time, you learn the system of the restaurant, how it work and everything; next thing you know you are the manager, but then you get tired and you quit your job, so then you can open your own place, and thanks to all you did in the restaurant now you have the experience to run your own place, and even better. everything you get in your life will be thanks to all you try and learn, because even though sometimes things get difficult, it will always have a reward at the end. this is like when we were kids, and our parents made us do things that we didn t like, for example, when i was a kid i hated to do my reading and writing homework, because i didn t know to do it, but now that i think about it, thanks to all the homework i did, now i know how to read and write in spanish and english, because even though i didn t want to do my homework, my parents push me to do it, to learn and to be better every day. when i was a kid, my grandma always told me to said ""excuse me and thank you,"" at some point i did it because my grandma told me to do it, but now i see that my grandma though me something a lot of people forgot to do. everything we learn make us better everyday. some people may believed inactivity is also something good; sometimes doing nothing, is doing more, and is okay to just stop everything and take a break once in a while, but just wait to see if things work by their own is not the best, if you want things to work in your life you have to work hard and never stop, because if you don t work for what you want nobody else will do it for you.

"i agree that the programs that allow students to graduate in three years, will be a perfect idea and everyone must like this. as i know some students really need to graduated early some of them need, to help their parents with some money. it s a good idea for students to finish high school in three years and enter college early. some districts are offering programs for students ; for example they are allowing them to graduated in three years some students need to help their parents with some money. also they want to graduate early because of college this programs really help students and high school. students who follow all this plans they have to be persistent to graduate in three years. to illustrated students wants this programs to be able to have the things that they want ; for example buy a car buy some clothes. also students enjoy to hang out with friends so if they graduated early, they will work and have some money to buy what do they want. students must follow all this plans to see the results. while some people think that it s a good idea for students to finish high school and three years to enter college early, others argue that students don t learn enough in three years. there are several s ideas that improve this such as they didn t focus in learn more about assessments. people think that they don t learn enough in three years, they missed classes that they might need in the future; for example construction class we don t know if one day we are going to work in construction then we will need some skills in that job . also advanced pe we are going to needed it for our healthy students need to know more about other classes that they might need it in the future. i think it s a perfect idea for the students who wants to get a diploma in three years. students need to work to help their parents for example pay the bills and all that. also students wants to work the year that they have off to save some money for college. in conclusion i like this idea because students have opportunities to be a better person in life.",3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.5,3.5883049964904785,3.3254635334014893,3.374803066253662,3.4550490379333496,3.3022091388702393,3.4255425930023193

"most students hope and enjoy a summer vacation after a long school year, but some educators thoughts are completely different as the way they should get their vacations. although, during the summer break some students do not retain information as easily when they return in the fall, overall, the summer is a good season to have a school break because of the great weather and the posibilities to get a job for students. initially, we all know summer is the best season of the year, because it brings more attractions. of course, the weather is one of the important factors that makes it possible. for example, amusement parks to entertain people, beaches s opening, as well as others entertainment places to go visit and have fun. summer also is a known as a time where family can share moments with others and recover all the energies leaving the stress at home. also many people likes the summer, beacuse you can practice any sport you want outside, a good way to decrease the percent of obesity and improve our helth. another advantage of the summer is that we have more sun light during this season than winter, spring or fall, it allowing us to get done more stuff we need to do and being productive with our time. in short, the students s vacations should be in summer, because is a great season to do many activities and enjoy with friends and family. in addition, as we have more attractions, more personal the companies need, which gives to many people the opportunity to get a job. as a students, a job is helpful in several aspects for good on their lives. for example, maturity, responsability , new experiences and connections-which is very important to your future. each one prepares you as a person to deal with your every day lives. also, students have enough time to save their money and keep it for their purposes, it can be for a college or buy whatever they want without the necessity to pay with their parents s money. as a result, students are aviable to gain their own money during the summer, because its offer more opportunities, and also gain new experiences that will help them move fordward. still, some may say that summer vacations are too long and there should be year-round schools, which would totaly change how long the breaks will be. then, students can have a balence on their personal lives and scholar lives. the knoledge they aquired is still fresh in their minds so, new stuff to learn will be easier for them and consequently they will obtain good grades. in summary, the significance of the idea to administrate better how long, and the appropiate time for a break is to know if it are gonna affect the student progress, which is the priority of the school. in conclusion, educators wants the best for students,and they just want to find out a better way to rise their progress making them as a better students improving their knoledges. but, it can becomes",3.5,3.5,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.8834388256073,3.9646739959716797,3.8921446800231934,4.0706963539123535,3.9537670612335205,3.8524253368377686

"in my opinion i agree honesty is the best policy sometimes, however, honesty might hurt a person s feelings because the quality of being truthfulness is the key through out life. for that reason to support my answer your being trustworthy is better than done or obtained without lying to that person. hurting them more when you lie to them then be hundred percent honest with that person. so that why i believe honesty is the best policy sometimes even if u might hurt a person feelings. first, not stealing, cheating because people will not have respect and lose trust for you. sometimes you could end up in bad situations and problems. so i feel like if you do these things i least own up to your problems by being honest by saying you did this or this happened. also, people will say bad names to you like your all lies, your not trustworthy, and your dishonest so if you don t want anyone in this world to call you these names be honest at all times. then, being careful and saying sorry to the things u told people that was a lie instead of being dishonest changing that honesty i say that people start thinking your real and wanna be friends with you. instead those people out there hating you and talking behind your back almost everyday. so if u do these things it could change you as what type person your now then back then and it will change how people act towards you or behind your back most of the times. next, not hiding anything frank from people. for example, generic_name dating her best friend boyfriend secretly. like you don t wanna hide anything from the people you love or care for you always wanna be honest with them no matter what. you could break there hearts by not telling them somethings if the situations important that they most know. if you don t be honest life will make you feel stressful by hiding all these things your hiding from people so you do not wanna hide anything from the people u love or care for. in conclusion, no one questioned the honesty of the judge s statement. so these are my main reasons to support why i agree with this old proverb says honesty is the best policy.",3.0,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.0,2.5,3.306929349899292,3.131330966949463,3.223480701446533,3.2817437648773193,3.170793294906616,3.130535125732422
it has been said that having a positive attitude is the key to success life. i agree but at the same time i disagree. first being positive can bring success in life we so many great people who found the key to success in being positive like micheal jordan. he was cut from his varsity basketball team but him being positive and putting in work help he found the key to success in his life. next my second reason i think being positive can be the key to success is. da baby he was always told we wasn t every going to be anything but had stayed humble and positive and keep his head up and now he is one of the top rappers of are time now. he has multiple gold and platinum records and he has millions of fans and followers he has people who want to see him because he stayed positive and found his key to success. last i disagree because having a positive attitude isnt always the key to success because when the people out in war doesnt have a positive attitude because they have to be ready for the enemy and i think you wouldnt want to have a positive mind set in that predicament. in conclusion being positive can sometimes be the key to life and sometimes not having a positive attitude can still be the key to life.,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.0,3.0,3.3762590885162354,3.1966404914855957,3.2156145572662354,3.341709613800049,3.2107341289520264,3.233328342437744

"i am agree with the positive actitute because that describe the kind of person that we are,with a positive actitute we can do our job very well, we can be succesful in the life with good and positive thoughs, and we could be very friendly with the people. first, we could do the job well with a positive actitute because we could have a good moment with the others employments. we can do a clear and a very good job. we will be very respecful with the more workers. we can help the other employments when the they could need help. we could have a funny and happy day if we do the things that we like. next, in the life we can be succesful if we have positive thoughts for our future. many people would like to help us if we have a good actitute. we could have many opportunities in the life beacuse the people could feel good and happy with our actitute. we can have good ideas about a bussines or our kind of life. we can have a good relation with the family and friends. finally, with a positive actitute we can try with respect to everybody. the respect is one of the more important things in the life because that show the kind of life that we are living, and we could show tthe respect with a positive acitute. if we show a positive actitute with the people we could to give to them a good day. if we have a good actitute in our home we have a good moment with the family and we will be happy. with a positive actitute we could have less problems in our life. in conclusion, i think that have a positive actitute is the keys of the life. we can good relations in our home, job, and with ours friends. the opportunities in our life could be more. do you think that you could have good relations with your family and friend if you have a negative actitute.",3.0,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,3.0523948669433594,3.055743932723999,3.0941457748413086,3.0405378341674805,2.9446945190429688,3.005195379257202
"i disagree with the fact that the school board wants to add an extra hour and a half to each school day. i disagree because many students might have something to do when they come out of school,they are also going to have to get used to a whole new schedule,and they might not have enough time to study or do their homework at home. after school many students might have something to do or attend. for example,students might have to attend a club, take care of one of their younger siblings, or maybe they have a job after school. if the school board adds another hour and half to a school day these students might have to miss the activity that they have or might have to change what they do. this is bad but what is even worse if having to get used to a whole new school day routine. they will need to get used to a different schedule or routine. students will have to get used to much more longer classes and having to leave at a later time. like i mention in my other paragraph sometimes students have things to do out of school,so they might have to change everything so that they will be able to attend or do what they need to do after school,for example,if they have a job they might have to change their job schedule so that they won t be late. this leads me to my other reason about not having time to do their work at home. students might not have to time to study or do their homework at home. think about it. by the time that students get home,eat,relax,and do anything else they do when they get home,they might end up starting their homework at a really late time. what if they have to study for a test,by the time they start studying they might only have an hour to do it. i know some people might say to their school work before anything else,but what if the student is not able to do their work right away. in conclusion the school board shouldn t add an extra hour and a half to each school. although, many people might think that it is a good idea to have extended school hours. it would save a lot of time and work to just leave the school hours like they already are. and,their wouldn t be a reason to add an hour and half because students get a most of their work done in the amount of time they give them in the school day.",4.5,4.0,3.5,4.0,3.5,3.5,3.903371572494507,4.000515937805176,4.116555690765381,4.126145839691162,3.9614837169647217,3.9845807552337646
"even though other believe working alone is easier and better. i strongly believe student do benefit from working in a group. working in a group has it s advantages, and i feel it s a better choice. when work work in a group you can see different ideas,learn to work with other and also you can met new people. when you work with other people you can see the different ideas also you can learn know things. you can see the same problem in different ways but as a group you try to find the best way to solve them. for example let s say you have to do a project for a class, and you have to do it in a group. as a group you can share you knowledge of what you know about the topic and share them with you group . also you can share you ideas with your group,and see if they like it or maybe they can add something more to your idea to make it a better one . you can see who you have in common with them also you can see the differences you have with you group members . working as a group can really have a good advantages. if it is a really big project you dint have to do it alone. also you can split work and everyone can get a small portion of the project. you can also see people creativity. in a group every one is good in something, so lets say if there is some who is really good at drawing and some one really good in writing then the project can look really nice and the penmanship will look great. you can get it done half as fast with every one in the group does what they have to do and work as a team . when you work in a group you can met new people. maybe you change schools. you do not know any one at your new school. when you work in a group, you can meet new people and make friends. it also work if you are shy because in a group you have to communicate with others to get the work done, or you are just a born leader you can help other how to start the project together or tell people how to do thing because they do not know what to do first. also it works so you can get out your confer zone and try new things. for example you really like to draw but you do not know how to draw really good maybe some one from your group knows how and they can teach you . as a conclusion i think student do benefit when they are in group. because not only they can share there different ideas. you learn how to work as a team. you can met new people, and make new friends.",3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.5,3.5,3.195600748062134,3.0382423400878906,2.9893953800201416,3.2063393592834473,2.8597378730773926,3.040618896484375

"if you challenge yourself, you will never become good at something you want to do or achieve it. others believe that challenging yourself won t improve your growth. it s only going to make people struggle. myself, however, agrees because putting yourself to a challenge can make people explore or learn many things. that is how many people become so talented at things they do now. going beyond can raise your confidence higher. my first time experiencing playing the flute was very difficult. the more time i practiced the notes and songs, the easier it got for me. after awhile, i wanted to to play a different instrument. the second instrument option for me when i began playing the flute was a violin. it was more difficult than playing the flute but eventually i got used to it. the more things anyone can accomplish, the more challenges there will be to be completed to improve growth. school is a good example of improving yourself. there are specific kids who has disability in learning called special ed. the experience of being in self-contained classes were easy. for the kids who are capable of being in a larger group class have to make growth in order for them to be in a co-taught class or regular classes. i ve got out of self-contained classes by making so many improvements to show that i don t need to be in self-contained. going beyond can make a big difference. going beyond the goal is a great feeling because the goal is achieved and then the on to the next level.",3.5,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.8572280406951904,4.000705242156982,3.9603779315948486,4.064571380615234,3.853579521179199,3.8060529232025146
"my thoughts on what author ralph waldo had wrote, is something i can agree with. the things i have experience and has made me the person i am today, has taught me that doing the same things will not help me learn and grow. being fearless and taking a risk on something, will change me and anyone else to a more powerful and successful person. when i was young, my parents had gotten me a bike with training wheels, i had started to ride it and it was pretty difficult to ride. every day when i came home from school, i would go outside and ride my bike. i started to get better and better, i was nt struggling anymore. my parent had saw that i have gotten the hang of it and told me that i should try and do it with out the training wheels. i was to afraid and nervous that i wouldnt be able to ride the bike with training wheels so i didn t let him take them off. he told me that if don t take the wheels off, how will i grow and take risks in life when im older and have big things that i d have to develop and learn what i made a mistake on not doing and learn from my mistake. so i started to think to myself, ""if i didn t take them off how will i know that im good or horrible"". i told my dad to take them off, once he took them off i was pretty scared but then i started to get better and better that i wasn t afraid. i was pretty proud of myself and gave me courage. once you ve done something in your life that was huge and still did the same thing over and over what would you grow from it. you are in this world to learn and grow. to become a stronger, and successful person to accomplish something big and grow from where they have started. if someone was to started off as a employee at mcdonald and was thinking of being a manager somewhere and have his own company how could he do that if he s just a worker at mcdonald. if he wanted to be a manager and own his own company, he would have to be the hardest worker there and show that he can handle and work and follow all the rules. he ends up getting a raise and is the employee of the month for showing that he s a hard worker. the manger realizes that he s got a big future ahead of him. year s later, he s a manager at his own company and is being successful in life he s learned that not giving up and risking things to become what he is now is incredible. last but not least, if someone is not challenging them self, how would they know that they are good at it and could be able to do so much. ralph waldo has gave",3.0,3.5,4.0,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.677523374557495,3.5325520038604736,3.5087788105010986,3.7354941368103027,3.5218472480773926,3.550055503845215
"in a centair time, many of us think about the benefits of working with a group or working alone. we the students treat the must that we can do to us califications. exist a controversy, that is how more we ca have concentration during the assigments in class. i think these thow ways of work , can get a good results. because working with a group or with ourselves , oneself have the responsability to concentrain and do our work. it is only put us effort to aprove classe. when we working with a group during in class, this are help for us in class to convert more fun. we can share our ideas to do more faster the assignments. also help to ourselves when one of the group don t usterstand about the topic. even if the assignment are complete , the rest of the time the members maybe can talk to each other. but this happen also when the students have a good communication and they are friendly. however sometimes can be difficult even the sudents don t try to study with the group or only due the part of oneself. sometimes is better working with agroup , because when working by oneself taht can be a little frustrate. students can have support with a group , but when a student working alone is difficult research information without a opion of another person. working with a group students can be more fiendly with anothers students of differents countries and they can be more caring. students can show their abilities and be more prepare when they get a job. also students learn more of the members . in totality this is a argument to the students that they can t work alone , but they have the opcion to work with a group to prepare. in conclusion , i agree that is more better to work with a group in class than alone . it is a benefits to discover new people, hear more ideas, and be fliendly. i think is more helpful to students do the assigments in class. work alone can be difficult , but sometimes these help oneself to be indepent . it is more great have a goup with members that gonna help. it is only concentration in a group or not , beacsuse oneself need to be more improve everyday and pass classes. work with effort , the students always need help in study in class is a benefit when students see all persons equal to working.",2.5,2.5,2.0,2.5,2.0,2.5,2.7528042793273926,2.639822244644165,2.5962727069854736,2.7596166133880615,2.581669569015503,2.6453592777252197

"do you think that too much oil in your food affect your health, or it improve the ability of how you work at school? i think food that contains too much oil makes you get sick and that s what we have right now, but others think different and they have their reasons too. although some say that the school s cafeteria should not change their food because the food that they are offering right now is especially made to make students work better actually, the school s cafeteria should change their food because it gives students more variation to eat and by having a healthier food less students will get sick. those who think that the school s cafeteria should not change their food have their reasons. one reason is that the food that they are offering makes students work better; this is because it has a lot of oil. scientific studies say that oil awake people, and make people do their usually activies better. also, students who have their test after lunch, and they have eat something that contains a lot of oil; they tend to get better scores than those who didn t eat at lunch; this might be because some of them can t think with the stomach empty, or it can be because oil really helps them concentrate, who knows right. the oil food doesn t sound that bad, isn t? but i will tell you next what is what i think that is bad about it. there are many people who think that the school s cafeteria should change their food. this is because they have their reasons, one reason is to make students eat healthier; this will help prevent students get sick. there are many sicknesses caused by oil, and one of them is cholesterol; cholesterol can kill people if you don t know how to take care of it. also, by preventing students get sick they will not lose any day of school, and that will help them have good attendance and they will not get lost in their important classes. for example: science, math and history. another reason to change the cafeteria s food is that it will give more variation for students to eat. this might sound simple, but by giving them more variation to eat; students will feel more free to explore food that they don t know. also, students will feel more comfortable as if they were at home because you know that when you are at home food variate and that makes it fun. moreover, variation of food will attract those who are more likely to stay out of the cafeteria; maybe they don t like the food that we have right now, and they are hoping that the cafeteria change the food. i think that by changing the food in the cafeteria will make a good impact in the school. in conclusion, i think that the principal of my school should change the cafeteria s food because the variation of food will make a good impact in students",3.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.5,3.0,3.7351317405700684,3.78938889503479,3.7740204334259033,3.743394374847412,3.594749689102173,3.7425172328948975
"i am agree with churchill s statement about that ""success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm."" failure plays an important role in the pursuit of the success. we learn of our owns mistakes, including others persons mistakes. at the same time, is very important to be enthusiasm and with a good attitude to address and learns of ours mistakes, to continue progressing in the pursuit of success. if we do not try, we do not make mistakes, if we do not make mistakes, we do not learn, and we will not be success as we want to. it is so important that when we make a failure. with enthusiasm, checking where did we fail, how can we fix it, and give the best of our self. you can see, that how the next time that you pass with the same circumstances, you will not make the same failure that you did the last time, and at the time you will became an expert according at the area you are trying to perform. do not let the fear of going from failure to failure, prevent you of pursuit the success. every vary make mistakes that is why, it is very important that we do not have to loss the enthusiasm. the enthusiasm is what make us, to stand up, learn of our failure, and continue pursuit the success, do not matter which one, or how it is the circumstances of our failure. at the same time you can learn of the failures of others persons. that way you do not have to pass with same circumstances that they pass before; and you can economize your time to success faster. listening, reading and paying close attention of what other person transmit about their failure can help us more then what can we think. imagine the much you can get just for give some of the minutes of your time, to listen the important things you can get from the failure of others. so open your mind and pay attention. in conclusion it is good to failure. every time we make a mistake, we learn about it, and we will never forget what we learn from them. therefore do not let a failure prevent you to be success, and learn of your failure and other people failure.",3.0,3.0,3.0,2.5,2.0,3.0,3.1815805435180664,2.865187168121338,2.900864839553833,3.13466215133667,2.839966058731079,2.8944573402404785

"two minds think better than one. working with someone else can bring many benefits and opportunities to everyone, but there is many people who prefer to work by their self . working in a group can help to have done everything on time, and we can establish a good environment in the classroom. each person have different opinions, and we have to respect it. working in groups help to have everything done on time, since we are gathering many types of ideas and information from everyone. for example, in usa there are a diversity of people from different parts around the world, and each person have a different opinions and ideas in how they see everything. however, some people think that they have better opinions about what they are doing than others, but an opinion or idea is just a help that can guide to the best option. having groups in classes is a help that can benefit. because, they are helping each other. when someone is working alone can be struggling and do not ask for any type of help to keep going and make things nicely. when we are working in groups, we can establish a good environment with our classmates, since there is a lot of communication between classmates. for example, if we work alone, we would not be able to communicate each other, because, everyone is concentrate in what are they doing. otherwise, people from different parts of the country would not have the opportunities to meet each other and learn different cultures from their classmates. knowing each other can create a calm and gradable place to stay and share with every student in the classroom. even other students would prefer to be there. many people would like to be in a place where they can share and work together. but many people are looking where they can work with people from different types of cultures and listen every idea or opinions in life. having someone to work with, can make evening easier than working alone. every teacher should allow or try to create a better place where students feel comfortable.",4.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4.0,3.883577346801758,4.036105632781982,3.928091287612915,4.092065811157227,4.0074262619018555,4.00129508972168
"students should commit to a career at a young age?. many people thing that this would be an advantage in the future, because if many students choose a career when they are young, then there s going to be more professionals that can help the country, but other people thing the opposite, because they thing that the students are not ready to choose a career,because they are not in the age to thing by themselves. in my opinion, i would say that both arguments have good reasons to support their arguments, but l would prefer to be disagree with this opposition. for my first reason, i would say that it s too much responsibility for their age, because they don t have the experience necessary to complete a career that they like, but they are not prepare to complete, however if they choose a career, then they have to worried about the college that they want and how much it s going to cost to them and their family to start a career, also because they are not going to take the career seriously, and it s going to be a waste of time in a career that they can not hold by themselves, so they are going to leave the career. in addition, my second reason is that they don t have the ability to maintain a career mentally, because they can not control their actions and thinking, and if they do things wrong ,and they try to solve their problems alone, it s going to be stressful for them, what can cause a distinct kind of future that they don t expect , so they can get affect by all the things that can occur on your way, and also because there s going to be people that instead of help you, it s going to use for their benefits, and one example of that is the people who works in factories, construction, and bussines. finally, my last reason talks about how much time they have to enjoy their life, if they have to work in their career at a young age, because you can choose to be a professional when you are young and find jobs with that kid of career, but if you already know that you are going to work almost the rest of your life to have better future and keep progressing, so why don t enjoy your youth and be happy doing things that you like, instead of worry about find a career that if you are not ready, it s going to make you problems that you don t want to have now. in conclusion, supporting with the reasons, i would like to say that the best thing to progress in life, is to find something that your are good, that you can control, and also something that you can make money with that, however if know what you want to do in the future, and you know how you are going to try to make it possible, why don t enjoy what you",3.0,2.0,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.551453113555908,3.450997829437256,3.4951295852661133,3.4849588871002197,3.437478542327881,3.420382499694824

"i have multiple talents and skills, but my favorite one is skateboarding. skateboarding is a very difficult skill it takes several hours, days maybe even years to accomplish and learn a trick on a skateboard, but that s why it s such a unique sport and skill. skateboarding has become a daily activity for me, it takes all my stress and problems away, that s why i enjoy it so much. i skate everywhere to the store, a friends house, and maybe even to school. although i get lots of injuries like scrapes, bruises and many more i still love this sport because skateboarding has taught me a lot like, being able to be confident when i try new things, getting right back up when i fall, and being able to learn from my mistakes. skateboarding isn t just a sport, skill, activity or hobby it s a way of life and even tho it may not be the safest sport ever it s still one of my favorite skills that i think i wont get bored of any time soon. when i was nine i had lots of friends that would skateboard and i didn t know anything about skateboarding at the time so it was really cool being able to observe such a unique sport. i would always see them practicing and skating everywhere and that encouraged me one day to try it. so a couple days later i went up to my parents and told them that i wanted to try something new and it was skateboarding, my mom said she would think about it because she didn t want me to hurt my self, but my dad on the other hand told me to just go for it and that s exactly what i did. the next day after school i asked my mom if we could go to the nearest skate shop and she said yes. once we got to the the skate shop i was looking around and i was so confused i saw decks wheels and so much more that i didnt even know about. so as i walked in the guy that was working there asked me ""is there something specific you are looking for"". i told him i was new to skateboarding and that i ve never been on top of one, so he taught me what i needed to know about a skateboard like about the deck, grip tape, trucks, wheels, and hardware. after that we got into assembling my first ever skateboard. once i was done picking out all the stuff that was going to be on my skateboard we payed and he stared assembling it, once he finished we left the skate shop and it was to dark so i didn t get to skate that day sadly. the next day i get back home from school i put down my backpack and i imedietly went outside to try my new skateboard out the only thing i knew was to ride but i imedietly fell in love with skating. since",2.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.0,2.5,3.6514523029327393,3.532517910003662,3.527838706970215,3.6047823429107666,3.3246634006500244,3.403681516647339
"schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by video conference. this might be a good option for students who really do need it but there is some other students who won t take this seriously. i am writing this essay with the porpuse of desagreement with the idea of providing this ""benefit"" to the students, this is a way of making students lose interest in school because they might think that they don t have to take the conference every time and they willl think that they can do it whenever they want which gives to think that they aren t prepare for making good decisions when it comes with schools classes. in my opinion this is an opportunity that the schools gives to the students to drop out of high school considering that students are teenagers and they don t have the same amount of responsability than adults in most cases. as a student i desagree with this option. we need to be able to communicate, create good group work, and meet people and i can assure that most of the students will ended up leaving this classes when they half way done. being with more students make classes fun, helpful and even more interesting, students sometimes needs to have a adult teaching them and having a conversation face to face instead a computer taking to them. taking classes online is a benefit when you know how to manage time for example: my brother is a college student who is getting his master degree in genetic engineering some of his classes wasn t a requirement that he had to take them inside school so he decide to take them online so he can have more free time when it comes with work and school. he made a study plan which consist in spending one hour each day so he can focus on his online classes which helps him to study for every single of his classes. my friend generic_name is a senior on high school and she decided to take two of her classes online so she can have enough time for work, school activities, and graduation plans. she has been overwhelm with all her activities and assignments which it made her drop out of one of her two online classes, she said she felt like she couldn t do it by herself which it made her start getting bad grades in her school classes. later she decided to take those classes in school so she can have her classmate help her in case she get stuck in a topic. i think this opportunity can make students get stuck and give up on school which it can t happen because we are the future. in conclusion this option has it advantages and disavantages which for some people might seems good and differentes but for some other this option seems to be useless when it comes with the progress that we do inside the school.",4.0,3.5,3.5,4.0,3.0,3.5,3.7084200382232666,3.5575597286224365,3.5212042331695557,3.6652748584747314,3.570042371749878,3.5798323154449463
"generic_name / / dear, mr generic_name. i am a student who is in attendance at your high school, writhing to you about the changing of our school menu. i for one think it s a grate idea to change our school menu into a much healthier one. our current school menu has its redeeming qualities, but it also has a few lose ends. for example; they serve things like pizza, burgers, rice with chicken, nachos, spaghetti, pb&j , and salad. do you see the problem with the food items listed above? % of the schools menu contain high levels of fat and carbohydrates, which is not a proper meal for a growing student, or any human being. i remember seeing posters like the food pyramid, posted on the lunch room walls of my middle and elementary schools, but not once did the school lunches follow that expatiation. this is the problem with the school menus all over america today, they serve fatty foods filled with carbohydrates and not enough protein, fibers, and good fats. as growing students, we need food that ll give us energy through out the day, and keep us focused in our classes, but the current menu isn t serving us the food we need; don t get me wrong, they have things like fruits, vegetables, and other good side options, but that s not enough. we need the main meal/ main dish to be the most healthiest thing on our trays, not the side dishes. the students at our school may be disappointed with the sudden change in the school menu, but they ll just have to adjust to a healthier menu. it ll be nice if the school menu items was a bit more healthier, but the side options must stay the same. the side options our school menu currently have are just fine; they meet the expatiation s of a healthy side option; the offer fruits vegetables and the occasional desert. the health of your students and my peers are important, and a big part of being healthy starts with what you put in your body, so please continue with the plan of changing the school menu, our future self s will deeply appreciate it. thank you for our time. sensually, generic_name.",3.0,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.8802144527435303,4.004173755645752,3.9937081336975098,4.0934343338012695,3.9587948322296143,4.268640518188477
"we live in a world were everything revolves around technology. people these days don t know what the world outside holds. why? because they always have their noses in their phones and they never take time to go outside. very few peoplw know what it s like to actually spend time outside. sports are another example, not only are they fun, but they are alsp helping you stay healthy especially if you play almost everyday. if you think about it every sport requires you to run or to keep moving. sports can also be something you do after dealing with a lot of stress or work. they were shown to be a good for both your body and your mind. families also become closer when they spend time together with no sort of technolgy that can distract them. i think now in days families aren t as close as they used to be because we spend to much time on our phones and not so much on the people who care about us. technology has advanced a lot in these past years and it is fine that people want to explore new things. but we shouldn t get lost in it and forget that there are other things waiting to be discovered beyond a tiny screen. activities like sports bring you better things than a tiny screen can.",3.5,3.5,4.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.525153636932373,3.4698712825775146,3.460064172744751,3.557356119155884,3.436950922012329,3.48292875289917

"my school should follow this model by extending the school day two hours, and four day school week. there are some benefits but also disadvantages. first reason, if we take only two hours of class during the day probable should more express try the best of us, for use that time of class. in contrast, lose hours in others things not necessary; with more hours and days off the students would be distract of the responsability that is demanding the school. second reason, less pressure for the students that have a job is a big idea taking the school day two hours, because they want time for both during the week. for example, i work hours in three day i came home so late, hungry, and tired sometimes i miss days of school, for that reason i think is benefit take time on sleep then came to the school just for few hours. but, one disadvantages that could be happent is less time of classes when the students don t work or spend time in others distraction. clearly, they feel more in liberty in do something else on free time, and would not put all in the study. third reason, another disadvantages is not focus at all maybe should not work that idea; in the way that lost time of school is lost sacred time. the teachers miss day of their job too, and the student do not see the loss of the oportunity that is the school. however, one benefit and important for the students is the repose, so when our brain is in repose with not too much pressure it was relax, and we going to be blessed. because, we have more time to think much better what we want to do for our future,so we think most clear. in conclusion, in my opinion it is a great idea if my school take a four day school week of two hours each day. obviously, it s probable that students feel more easy in this way, for making their homework with time, wisdom, and decoration. finally,the school will make the change for a good reason.",3.0,2.5,2.5,2.0,2.0,3.0,3.061352014541626,2.8348989486694336,2.8465640544891357,3.0234270095825195,2.823120355606079,2.7803568840026855

"have you ever wonder how our character is formed? john lubbock once wrote, "" your character will be what you yourself choose to make it."" i personally think that our character is formed by our friends, social media, and so that people can like us. many people believe that we choose our own character by being ourself and not caring what anyone thinks however, i think that our character is formed by our friends since were always with them. for example, if my friends are always skipping school and they ask me to skip school with them and i am going to say yes since, they are my friends. what most do us do is ,that we can not say no to our friends and by saying yes, it makes up our character because now people see us as a person who skips school. another reason on why our character is influenced by other people is, because of social media. social media plays a big part on how our character is formed. for example, on social media there is a lot of models, and singers. a lot of young teens want to be like them so they will change the way the look and act. since society has made it seem that if you don t look like kylie jenner or any other famous person that you re not pretty and because, of that people want to change their character. finally, our character is formed by who we are around is because we want people to like us. for example, if i am at school and i want to be friends with a group of girls i will do what they like and do what they do all the time so, that they can like me. since i want them to like me i will end up changing my personality and look just so that they can like me; this makes my character be influenced by others. i urge you to think about your character if it s formed by the way you choose or if it is formed by who you surround yourself with. we should not let people choose how they want our character to be. i personally think that our character is formed by our friends, social media, and so that people can like us.",3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.5,3.0,3.73669695854187,3.7647907733917236,3.7670016288757324,4.0691728591918945,3.752758264541626,3.7826972007751465
"i agree with the former british prime minister winston churchill because in my opinion, the failure makes to the people strong and the next time they can do it better. sometimes we are making failures day per day, but if we become sad and we are closed that we can not do it again, we are losing something important in our life, but if we are doing it with enthusiasm we can improve our failures and do it better every time. success is the achievement of doing what you have tried to do or what to do. winston churchill is referring that no one have to loss the enthusiasm, however if you are making mistakes in your life and you are saying that you can not do it and you will try it but you are going to get the same results and you are giving excuse by excuse you will fail in your life because you are giving up easily and you dont see that every cost and fight at the end it has a benefit or something that you really wanted to get or a goal that you are trying to reach and you will see that you dont have to loss the hope and the enthusiasm in every dream that you want. the failure has an important role in the pursuit of success, sometimes a lot of people do not have the enthusiasm and they think that it is the end of everything, the failure can be the destruction for a lot of people, but if you make a lot of mistakes and you are keeping fighting still to get your goals you will see how important is not give up easy and watch the positive part of your failures. when winston churchill said ""success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm,"" he is only saying that sentence but it has a big meaning everybody can apply it in their lives, you can find the best outcomes just smiling to the problems. it does not mean that you will not care the problems, of course you have to resolve the problems and make them clear, because if you are making failures and people is affected and you dont care you just want to get your outcomes it will be a big problem, no body needs to be involved in your failures because the people around you will see that you are making a mistake and you are selfish. churchill s statement has big meanings and has good outcomes, everybody wants success but what happen when someone is trying to get success and miss? of course everyone will feel so sad and no one wants to try it again because the person is afraid of their failures, it is like if the failure is tying you and it does not want to leave you. the persons will be sad and their hopes will be down because they think that they are going the get the same outcome, but what happen if you raise your head with",3.5,3.0,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.4827229976654053,3.3551225662231445,3.527851104736328,3.4848825931549072,3.445509195327759,3.3493969440460205

"success is about to enforced our self and to accomplish our goals, as i know nobody was born knowing something everyone was born to learn and to fail every time that is possible to learn more however i agree with churchill s statement that is about the important role that failure plays in the success, my reasons are that we can protrude, influenced others, more personal experience. my first reason is that everyone can protrude and be proud over our self ,and protrude means to take the best of us and show it, for example, in my case lass year i loss my job because i didn t have enough age to work in the company this year i start my own company and i have my own employees, this is a example how failure didn t take my enthusiasm, and that we can loss twice maybe but not forever because be will be success later. my second reason is that our attitude is everything we can infused others that have been losing their life and their enthusiasm and show them that everyone can enforced and get what they want, a example will be my cousin she had been in grade for years that at the first year that she didn t pass her grade herself confidence went down and she had loss her goals, but this year she will graduate because this year she is been preparing to pass her classes and to get her diploma, this is a example of been failing, and failing and then get the success. other might say that success and failing isn t good for our society, however i sill disagree because to get success or to win we have to learn from the beginning, my third reason is that with the experience what we have of been losing and failure twice and twice we will know that we are going to do and be successful later. according to a quote that say you can loss a battle but not the war , in fact we can loss everything but not our enthusiasm. in conclusion, this is why i agree with churchill s statement that is about the important role that failure plays in the success, my reasons are that we can protrude, influenced others, more personal experience. everyone is exert to failure but what we have to do is to continue and don t surrender don t give up with our goals, always been happy doesn t paying attention to the situation.",3.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.5,3.1721997261047363,2.7976434230804443,2.8670334815979004,3.126751661300659,2.825788736343384,2.8469021320343018

some people say working alone is more benifical. well i think working in a group is more benifical. my first reason is it keeps you away from boredom. it keeps you away from starring at a wall for hours. and it keeps you away from sleeping in a class room. its more helpful having someone to raise and boost your energy and being the confident person you are. now days in a classroom were haveing percentr on students being unsure about there answers and being unsure if they should even speak up. being in a group helps you raise your voice. manny adult and students are suffering boredom and thats not healthy. talking to your peers and being around people more keeps you away from depression. making your self feel more confident about yourself shows who you really are its like the next step to being a risk taker. my second reason is you can talk and discuss with your group about your project or work together. its more faster being in a group where you can actually discuss about your thoughts and idea and feeling more confident than ever. having a partner check it look togerther for any mistake or errors. my final reason is you save lots of time for yourself. and not everyone is right. but creating these ideas from yourself and your group could make something turn out to be unthinkable. being in a group makes your mind grow and learn new things and ideas from other people. your having a good time with your friends and if not you meet new people that may become friends with you. you want to talk and move around and meet new people getting out. not being shy or denying yourself wrong. being in a group is like your bring peace in a table. i belive that everyone should try new things being in a groups and its okay if your wrong because there is no right answer. being in a group helps you become bigger and bold about yourself your trusting you self and your classmate. i believe working in a group is more benificaial rather than working along cecking your self and thinking if your rong and feeling unpositive about yourself.,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.5,3.0,2.5,3.555622100830078,3.5583863258361816,3.433350086212158,3.4349050521850586,3.451686143875122,3.435396671295166
"people should not make their own decisions because people hurts someone feelings about the decisions they are making, people always need someone to be agree if their decisions are good to make it, and people think just because they are old enough can make better decisions. people hurts someone feelings because they made something really bad even if a person tells them that they are doing wrong things, they keep doing it, because for them the decisions that they are making are great for them. one example, lets say, when we were young that we fall a lot time in love. we were wishing to have someone to advise us because we think if the decision that we are going to make is not going to hurt someone. we always think about what is going to happen if we do things that we know are not good choices. we need somebody to advise us about anything. another example, when i was planing to leave my house with my boyfriend because i did not wanted to go to school. i get really mad. i did not think on anything. i just wanted to do it even if mom gets a heart attack because she wants me be more educate and have a better future, so someone that i have not seen in my whole life get close to me and say "" you are too young, think about what life can brings you if you go to school, if you graduate from college that many wonderful thing you can have. do not throw your life in that way. you will have time to be with someone"" i realized that i was making the worse decision ever. everyone always need someone to be agree about their decisions, because someone may have a lot of experience about life that way they can be the guide for them. they can talk about the decisions that they were making in the past and that can helps to make a good decisions. one example, one friend made a bad a really bad decision. his family told him to stop doing the things he was doing because it will be a lot consequences. that is what happened he made a wrong decision. he did not listen and now is dead because of his decisions. most think that they are old enough to take their own decisions, as we can see, it does not matter what age we have. what matters is how mature we are, because we have to be aware of the responsibility about any kind of decisions we are going to make. we have to say to ourselves "" okay if i do this i have to be conform about the result that i am going to get"". clearly, all we do is because someone is making us better by telling that we do not always have to trust on ourselves. sometimes for some discussion we do not do the right thing, we do not think and we use our bad mood and due to that we",3.5,2.5,3.0,2.5,2.0,3.0,3.3763976097106934,3.207811117172241,3.1929805278778076,3.3324015140533447,3.1571037769317627,3.2622978687286377

"former british prime minister winston churchill stated a quote that said, ""success consists of going from failure to failure with out loss."" there are reasons why i agree with this statement. the first reason is, failing will want to make you push for a success, the second reason being that you ll have more of enthusiasm when you re find more ways to succesed, and the third reason is achiving for higher goals. i agree strongly with this prompt and winston chruchill s quote, yet some people think it s something at may not be true and think less of them self. in the first paragraph i will explain my first reasoning with a strong example of it. first, reasoning to this prompt would be, falling will want to make you push for success. even though not many people think that is the way that many of our past inventors had learned. albert enstine was one of the smartest people out there, yet he had come face to face with failure many times in his life. the only way he learned was to try many other different ways to solve his problems. he used failure as an insperation to to keep trying like our first inventor of the light blub. even though many people found it frusterated and diffivult when they ve failed, which pushes on to my second reasoning. next, the reason would be that many people think different about them selfs when they fail in something. thomas edison thought different, even though he had failed times, he had not gave up. when he finally successed, he said a quote that is in my mind till today in this presnet day. that quote was ""i didn t fail times, i found ways that it didn t work."" even though, thomas edison had failed he maintaned him self with a lot of enthusiasm, failure is never an option, but finding a solution to it is a success. finally, the last and final reason is achiving for high goals that you want to reach. it don t matter what others may think of it or if you ll be able to achive or not. show them that they are wrong even if you come to a failure don t stop, find a solution and fix it to make it better than before. you ll reach higher goals with higher potential then what you ll ever imagine. then later on you will be able to do anything you put your mind to and demonstrate your knowlage to the world. in conclusion, doubting yourself is not how you achive your success. finding a way to solve it is achive your success. get the insperation from the people who had once been in your spot and they done to successed to there goal. even if failure is a role in life to find success it s the only way youll reach it. failure is only a motivation to get you to successed.",4.0,3.0,4.0,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.5625433921813965,3.566056728363037,3.6139514446258545,3.5352156162261963,3.5197246074676514,3.5351319313049316

"inactive times and its benefits should people have inactive times in their life? by doing work all the time people can achieve more goals; however, is better for people to have inactive times. it is better for people to have inactive times because they can have a longer life, fresh ideas, and get more energy. firstly, it is better for people to have inactive times because they can have a longer life. people s body works better when they have time to rest. for example, my mother s friend had a heart attack for not having inactive times. his doctor recommend him to have lazy times because he was working eighteen hours per day, but he did not listen to what the doctor said. as a consequence, he pass away; however, before he was told to have inactive times, his neuron system stopped working properly. he stared having bad times at night while he was sleeping, his body started shaking, and he started having heavy breathing. the doctor asked my mother to talk to him and explained one of bad results, and that was death. right after my mother s friend pass away, the doctor wrote on his blog about how not having inactive times can kill us. in sum, having inactive times help people live a longer life. secondly, it is better for people to have inactive times because they can have fresh ideas. when our brain is full of tasks we cannot think clearly and have new ideas. being busy makes our mind blocked. for example, generic_name is a teacher and she is planning to have a party. however, generic_name is been so busy because her class is having a competition. all she thinks about is the competition and how to prepared her class. generic_name is not having inactive times and she does not know how to organized the party. she tried to focused on the party, but each small action was in vane. her boss noticed she was tired and did not have new ideas, so her boss let her have two days off. during those two day generic_name could came up with lots of ideas to her party and also ideas to the competition. generic_name was happy because her main was full of new and fresh ideas. her class won the competition and her party was amazing. in conclusion, by having inactive times people can get fresh ideas. thirdly, it is better for people to have inactive times because they get more energy. people who rest feel more energetic to start or finish an activity. for example, when i have many homework ,exams coming up, and track practice i feel upset, frustrated, and with no energy. so what i do is rest for a while to get energy. this make me feel powerful and energetic to finish my different activities. furthermore, in my psychology class i learned that people who rest or get an inactive time after they done with an activity for twenty five minutes have more energy to continue another task. in my personal experience, i",3.0,4.0,3.5,4.0,3.5,4.0,3.5223209857940674,3.3450779914855957,3.3934504985809326,3.4414844512939453,3.362997531890869,3.4492685794830322
"some schools have a program that older students pair with younger students and lets talk about how the effects can be very beneficial in the students future. one reason this would be most beneficial is that the younger students are getting there education from someone who already knows about the basic of reading, pronouncing words the younger students just have not reach potentacil and these older students are pushing these younger kids the right way. another reason having older students pair up with younger students is a very beneficial idea is that it teaches a students what skills are necessary to be a teacher just encase they want to be a teacher one day. third reason a younger student pairing up with an older student is beneficial is because it makes the older student feel more responsible for somebody else is learning like making sure the younger student knows this like making sure he/she knows how to pronounce words correctly make sure the younger student can be organized. a fourth reason that proves younger kids pairing up with older kids is beneficial is that the teacher has a couple less students to deal with so less stress to deal with younger kids can be annoying to deal with sometimes.",3.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,2.5,2.5,3.6262881755828857,3.3186962604522705,3.3287911415100098,3.623361587524414,3.3359930515289307,3.415830373764038
"thomas jefferson once said ""determined never to be idle... it is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing ."" lening never wanted to be idle,for he kept on playing apex legends to be good at it. he worked hard. he reached his goal of winning a match on apex legends. lening reached his goals because he was never idle, for he was always doing something in his life. although some say that inactivity serves a purpose because we can wait for the right moment to start an errand or chore, actually being active serves a purpose because we can increase our knowledge in; work,home and gaming and if we are studying a subject such as; medicine, d animated cartoons and cybersecurity we can master it ,and later on we can teach others. some say that inactivity serves a purpose because we can wait for the right moment to start an errand or chore. once a read an article on newsela that was about how a men waited to start his goal, and he ended up getting his goal very quick. the man was called generic_name. generic_name wanted to save up to buy a house. he started ti save up for two months, later on he won the lottery, generic_name was very happy about it, then he deposited all his money into his savings account. time pass by and he realized he had enough money to buy his dreamed house. generic_name bought the house, and he lived happily ever after. if we are inactive we can wait for the right moment to start and errand or chore. my aunt(generic_name) wanted to do and errand but she decided to wait because she saw on cnn news that if we wait to do and errand or chore the succession rate increases by %. she did the errand and it went more smoothly than ever, he waited to do it and she succeeded on doing it. being inactive for a while it s good because if we decide to rush things the odds might be against us. my friend generic_name always like to rush things. one day he couldn t wait to buy a game that he went in the middle of the night to buy it. when he got to the store, the store was already closed. he walked form the game store to his house. he was very sad that he could not bought the game, later on he saw a women in white standing right in front of him. he woman in white turn down and he saw her.. the we ran like crazy. it s always better to wait to do something such as buying a game, don;t rush things or you will end up like generic_name. it s so good how many we can accomplish if we are always doing something, but if we are inactive we can always wait for the right moment to start doing something.

"i think that school should not follow the business model. adding two more hours to the schedule is not worth it for example some student need that time to other activities like go to the gym or play any sport and by adding two more hours that means that they are not going to be able to do all kinds of activities after they get out of school. there are some student whom work after they get out from school, they need that time to go work and make their money and having to stay on school two more hours means that are not going to have the same time as before to work also means that they are going to make less money. staying on school two more hours will be a difficult task like myself i need go home after i am done with school because i have to take care of my house like make my sister food and clean my house i have to do that every day after i get out from school that is why it will be difficult task to do for me to stay two more hours on school. i think that adding two more hours to the schedule and only having to go to school for four days only is not good idea sure we want to save energy as well but school can not afford to follow the businesses model. for example student can not afford to stay on school for straight hours they are going be really tired and by being like that they might do their work wrong. also those student whom work after school if they stay two more hours i think that they are going to be really tired for work i have some friends they start working at pm they get out of pm that means that they will have time to rest for two hours but if they have two stay on school for two more hours that means that they will get out of school at pm so they are not going to have time rest an just have to go straight to work. another disadvantage of getting two more hours of school is that for those students whom works and get homework that means that they will not have time to do their homework for example myself i have to go home early to take care of my house i have to care of my house quickly so i can start doing my homework so staying two more hours on school for me it will be difficult to do all of that task after i get out from school. of course there are some benefits from adding two more hours to the school schedule like saving resources and saving energy also those student whom does not do anything after school can learn more because they can concentrate more they does no to worry about what they are going to do after school. there are some student whom does not do anything after they get",3.5,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.636958599090576,3.4290244579315186,3.5010738372802734,3.7146828174591064,3.392936944961548,3.4816172122955322
"thomas jefferson wrote, ""determine never to be idle... it is wonderful how much can be done if we are always doing."" jefferson s quote is accurate because we can not accomplish something without doing something in life. everyone has a goal in life; to meet those goals we have to prepare and take steps to complete them. some people may say that inactivity can also serve a purpose because there are people, including: famous people, family members, or teachers who has once been passionate about something they have done in their lives who quit and became someone bigger, but they are wrong. there is a lot that can be done and steps to take if we are always doing something for ourselves or for others because instead of doing nothing we can focus on our education to help us in the future or to make this world a better and wonderful place for everyone. for starters, when students focus on their education all the time there is a lot that can be done. one reason why students can do so much with our education is because often education can prepare us for a big exams. for example, in class students are learning and reviewing different tropics repeatedly, which will help us pass any exams that will be given to us. this proves that when students are constantly learning something they can accomplish anything that they were leaning or reviewing throughout the year. this shows students how much they have done by focusing, instead of doing nothing. another reason why students can do so much with their education is because it can help them graduate and accomplish bigger things in life. for example, most students that are always on task and doing everything that they should be doing have bigger plans in life than those who do not. this proves that students that accomplish more by being on task with their education will graduate with a future ahead of them. as a result, students that are focus and on task are more likely to feel incredible for everything they have accomplished in their education. second, a lot of people around the world can do so much to help other communities by volunteering and to make this world a better place. a reason why it is wonderful how much can be done if we are always doing something is because we can help those around us. for instances, there is a lot of people around the world that need our help, such as homeless people or families who live poor. we as a community can feed those who are homeless or can help families who need help with jobs or to get health insurance. this shows, that if we gather together as a group we can see how much we have done to help these people in need. another reason to see how much we can do together is by making great choices in life. for example, we can plant fruits and vegetables and give them out for free to help people around us",4.0,4.5,4.5,4.0,4.0,4.5,3.8675341606140137,4.254460334777832,4.2822089195251465,4.103809833526611,4.289119720458984,4.341148376464844
"the success is achieve something, is like a goal that we want reach. nobody is perfect in this life, at contrary all the people make mistakes. for example: when i try to cook something to eat, sometimes i forgot to add an ingredient. as a result of this mistake the food obtain a different flavor, but of this failure i can learn and upgrade my skills like a chef. another example could be: when a student fail in a test, but has the chance to take a retake, is there when the student spend all their time studying to get a better grade. daily the people commit diverse mistakes, but depend of us to determine if this mistakes will define us. also we can take with enthusiasm this kind of failures and learn from them. don t give up, we have to be strong. that a mistake don t stop you of achieve your goals. a characteristic of the humans is that we try to overcome all the challenges that we have in our life. the failures teach us how to be a best person. the people just have to be more optimistics and see the failures from a good point of view. if you are negative with a failure or mistake, let me tell you that maybe you will loss the battle with yourself. if you are negative, is very probably that you will start to have bad thoughts about yourself. if you are negative, you never will be happy again, because you will stay thinking in the failure you had. i m telling you all this, because i had this kind of problems previously. in conclusion, don t let to the failures defeat you. you have to be strong and learn of them, to be a best person in the future. or you want stay in the same place, with the same problems forever? no, right? you have to figth to overcome all the challenges that will appear in your life, and remember never give up. let me tell you something else, i don t know a lot of english and i m taking this test that have to be in english. i m bringing all of me to get a good grade, what i mean with this. well, even if i don t have a good grade, i learn many things that will help me in the future. i will not let the failure defeat me again, i will return more strong and with more knowledge.",3.5,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.063833475112915,3.0417158603668213,3.010119915008545,3.0487141609191895,2.972996234893799,3.0602869987487793
"one topic that people debate a lot is that students expected to identify a career by the time they enter high school. they courses of study in high school are selected to guide them toward a specific career. i think is not a good idea for a student to commit to a career at a young age. because students are not old enough they careless and not make the best decision when they at a young age. one reason why this would not be a good idea is because, students are not old enough to know what they career in specific. they not prepared for the world students in high school don t have any experience of any career. i think is a little to early. i will explore all type of career when my senior junior year starts i would make sure to select the right courses and the better one to be prepared or have experience for your career. one reason why this would not be a good idea is because sometimes teenagers are careless something may go wrong with your life or you just wanna do something new. all those classes that i selected from freshman year are not gonna be worth it because you gonna have to take new classes. for example my friend selected a technology class in freshman year, and he search it up how much they make in a year and that was not what he expected. so he change to materials and process to learn how to cut, and built houses. one reason why this would not be a good idea is because, when you are in a young are you make the wrong decision well sometimes but i think the best decision for me during high school is to to wait and study the better classes and the best and better career. and to be able to do that you have to care about classes and be responsible with school and career. as you read you can see the reasons,i think the best idea for students is to focus in high school and get good grades when you get to senior year or college, you know more about life and careers i think that would be the best time to selected the best classes that are gonna guide you toward a specific career.",2.5,2.0,3.0,2.5,2.5,2.5,3.033944845199585,2.865983247756958,2.8313775062561035,2.9986462593078613,2.8287582397460938,2.9757883548736572
"technically, students spend seven hours in school and seventeen hours at home regardless of what time they sleep or what they do when they get home. students should have more time to study at home, rest and prepare for the next day. more hours in school will ware out the student causing it to effect their grades. i disagree with the school board s plan to extend the school day because students have extracurricular activities to do when they are not at school,and it disturb both the students and the teachers personal life. not all activities student perform happens in school. adding an hour and a half to the school day can affect the student progress at home. for example, a student can be a player in a local soccer or basketball team, adding more hour will give the student less time to practice and get ready to the game or match and the student will also have little time to do his/her homework or complete an assignment or project given to them. the student having less time to practice is going to take a big tow on his/her team. maybe the student is a very good player and his/her team needs him/her,he/she having small time to practice will make the team lose the match. this decision will not only effect the student but the teachers too. everyone wants to go home and relax from a long day work. the decision of adding ninety minutes to the school day is going to interrupt what the teacher and student do in their everyday life. some teachers have families they have to take care of. they may have to pick their child or children from the babysitter, preschool or school if the don t use the bus. they also have doctor or dentist appointment they have to attend or have to take their children to. teachers have chores or duties they must preform at home like shopping for groceries or picking little brother or sister from school. it could also be that they have another place to work at after school in order to earn more money. both students and teacher have busy lives this decision is going to effect them. there are many reasons why adding one hour and a half is bad but these are the ones i could come up with. i disagree with the school board s idea to extend the school day because students have extracurricular activities to do when they are not at school,and it disturb both the students and the teachers personal life. i think if the school board is going to add more time to the school they should high the pay of the teacher because it take time off their schedule.",3.5,4.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,4.0,3.880478620529175,4.026393890380859,4.080505847930908,4.114948272705078,3.944647789001465,3.9251151084899902
"today i will be discuss if it is a good idea for students to commit to a career at a young age? most may disagree with this statement, but i will hopefully grab your attention and hope you could agree with me. i think it is a good for students to decide on there career this early because number one in today s society everything is depended on technology. what are students into nowadays there phones, video game, ipads , computers, etc. so pretty high advanced technology is everywhere, my point that i m trying to make here is that the majority of students get either there phones or computers at a young age. so in my opinion i think that there future is set way before high school. but again my point here is that yes i do agree that careers should be set when they enter high school. with entering high school students are introduced to a lot of programs at the start of there new journey to life. theres programs in high school that take students to colleges and take them on tours or they either tell the what to major on in that specific college, with planning early for your future you save time for stressing out last minute. i feel like this shouldn t just be small societies making students plan really early this should be the whole nation because as students we are the future of the united states so why not start or years ahead. although some people may say that this is a huge distraction only because students would want to just focus on the future instead of focusing on whats happening right now. so the main argument is that i % agree with students choosing there careers at a young age. my main reason is that the early the better with chances of programs and guidelines to help you on your way to a better education theres no way that you can stress for a career. in addition to my statement i also think that schools should have a bunch of programs helping students out with there future that way they won t stress there last year of high school, and they won t have to apply to colleges not knowing what to do.",3.5,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.0,3.6751937866210938,3.5544188022613525,3.6230578422546387,3.6497802734375,3.654282808303833,3.6565091609954834

no not good for older and younger students to be in a program. but sometimes older kids become mean and don t care about the younger just care themself to have fun. it s not normal for that to happen and it will feel weird harder stuff for the younger ones don t know and the older kids think it s too easy. there s so much reasons that it shouldn t happen doesnn t feel right. if it was like in the summer for an activity that would be great because you learn about how the older and younger kids are. the younger kids will want to do childess stuff and the older ones want to just be on there phones and just talk. sometimes the older ones need to teach the younger ones to be more grown up so they learn about the older ones. the teachers mostly will try to tell the older ones to help the younger ones to be grown up. so usually they shouldn t create schools like that it will feel completly different because there will be different stuff then real schools with older and older kids and younger and younger kids. the younger ones could sometimes scream and run or goof around a lot and the older ones sometimes will feel annoyed by them. so lot s times i feel like the older ones will feel unconfortable from the little ones. when you grow older you learn what you do now and not like when you were younger. most the time you usually want to be friends with people your age not too much of a different age. sometimes it can happen to be friends with someone older or younger but most times your age. always try to be yourself and not change your additude. sometimes the older kids will need to try make the little kids happy by talking with them and have fun with them. but not for to long you should because it will get boring doing it for a long time. when u finshis they will sometimes try bothering you because they liked what you did but just leave them alone after. these are examples why sometimes you should or shouldn t allow those schools with older and younger students. after when you grow older you the one teaching the new kids to be grown up. try remeber the times you were little and what the older kids did to you do that with others. but there could be lot s of times younger ones a different and you were that way years ago. help everyone be a grown up kid and still think not too much they should add schools with older and younger kids.,2.5,2.5,2.5,3.0,3.0,3.5,3.1191625595092773,3.057175397872925,3.121561050415039,3.0648608207702637,2.9064645767211914,2.9745538234710693

"is a positive attitude key to success? well, in my opinion i strongly agree, i believe a positive attitude will take you far in life and will let you accomplish many goals you ve set for yourself. for instance having a positive attitude doesnt just affect you but it also affects others in a negative or positive way, for example motivation; you could motivate someone and inspire them just by doing you and accomplishing youre goals or you could even brighten somebodies day up by doing small gestures. in the other hand there will be people that dont want too see you do good, people that want to bring you down and people that have envy over you. that shouldn t bring you down that should be more motivation to do better because those are people who are jealous, people that are jealous of something you have and that they dont have. there are people who have started from the bottom with very little and are now doing big things, by having a positive mind set and believing in themselves. a positive attitude is the key to success all you need is to believe in yourself, have patience, and ignore all the ignorant people. in my experience a positive attitude is a key to success, why? well, when i was younger i had a difficult time with the english language because i only spoke spanish at the time, which then resulted that i had to repeat a grade. being left behind made me feel dumb and stupid, i also felt embarrassed; embarrassed of saying my age to the other kids when they would ask how old i was, i thought they would make fun of me and call me names. through out the years i got more mature and i didnt really care no more about my age, i then found out that there were other kids that were in the same situation as me, which made me feel better about myself after. when i got to high school i met my case manager, he was and still is a really nice guy and really cares about the students. when i met him he asked me many questions one of them was how old i was when i told him he was surprised because i was older then the other students. he then asked why i was years old with freshmen classes, i told him why and he understood. a few days pasted by and he asked me how i felt being behind the sophomore class, i told him i didnt like it and how i felt a little dumb. he then told me how i would feel about graduating with that class, i then knew what he was about to tell me and i liked the idea of it. he told me i could do three years but i would have to do two years in one, i didnt care if it would be more work all i was thinking of was graduating on time. so, of course i accepted and",3.5,3.5,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.5,3.8647890090942383,3.7894794940948486,3.8384218215942383,4.034490585327148,3.711711883544922,3.768313407897949

"some schools offer distance learning as and option for students to attend classes from home by way of online video conferencing ,do you think students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home? there are too many ways to appreciate the opportunity to take online classes ,at my point of view this is a good tool to people who s not able to attend to a regular school or for people who needs more credits to graduated .some people attend to take online classes because they don t have enough time to attend to a regular school because they have to work in the morning to support a family, take classes online is the best way to get a career ,and get a better job. this tools would benefits people ,i have my own example that take classes online is really helpful to graduate because ,i am taking classes online because i need credits to graduate and it is a good opportunity that some schools offer to students in the same way as me .one of the advantage at being taking classes at home is that you can work and study at the same time ,and you can have your own schedule and the best thing is at home you dont have to travel to other place . when you are taking online classes you are allow to work whenever you want ,and also you can eating at the same time because you dont have nobody to pressure you to do the assignment because you have the enough time . however there also some disadvantage of take online classes because sometimes the students don t use this opportunity from the best way .one disadvantage is that some students when they are taking online classes they can uses the phone and those devices distract them so much,sometimes they don t have nobody to help them if have any question or needs help with something . one more disadvantage is that when the students are taking classes online they attend to loss interest and prefers do other things instead of do their assignments ,because they don t even care about their grades because they don t have a teacher to pressure them to do their assignments ,but everything depends how much interest the student put in pass the online classes to improve the grades and gained more knowledge .sometimes when the students take online classes and regular school they attend to violated the rules of the school because they are accustomed to be in the habit of work at home they dont want to follow the directions of the teacher, and they also what to do whatever they want and that is not fear for the teacher who has to tolerate it. there are some advantages and disadvantage of attend classes from home by online classes ,but everything depends the way that you uses this tools to gained more knowledge and be prepared for life .",3.0,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,3.0,3.57232928276062,3.346259593963623,3.485780715942383,3.533973455429077,3.3710625171661377,3.4178659915924072
"to accomplish something there is always gonna be some inactivity once and a while. well everyone has their own different type of way to accomplish something, but there is always some kind of inactivity at times; but not always. i think that we really do accomplish more when there is something else happening. everyone in this world is different compared to the next person. everyone has their own unique style of completing an assignment. some examples are listening to music , working outside, working with someone else, and basically anywhere else. these small things can help somebody to stay in task to complete something. myself personally i love to be listening to music to get my assignments done. i am able to accomplish more than what i usually do. before i never got my school work completed cause i was really bored of doing it, but when i first played music. i was flowing threw to get my work done. sometimes when trying to accomplish anything in life. some people may experience some inactivity. two things that happen the most to people are zoning out or a phone notification. these two things are what happens to people the most, but they can always prevent it from happening. me for myself i love using my phone. i never get bored of it. sometimes while i m working to get my assignments done and complete. there will always be a notification that will make my phone go ""buzz buzz"" and then ill have the courage to see what it is. now i have overcome that. what i do now is i put my phone on silent away from me while its connected to my bluetooth speaker playing music. this always helps me from zoning out. music playing in the background prevents me from zoning out. some people can complete everything without a doubt, but not everyone could stay on task to complete something to accomplish it. we all had accomplish something in this world; but some people havent accomplish anything at all. their minds are not set for reality i must say. their minds are inactive and not set for anything. people can change. anything can happen. nothing in this world is really impossible, well if you set your mind to it. people dont believe in themselves to accomplish anything. the inactivity that they got can change. before i used to never get anything completed/accomplish. i was thought i wasnt enough to do anything. i always made bad choices. my mind wasnt set for anything. i didnt care. i thought my life was a joke and soon it will be over as soon as i know it. school was hard. i didnt really get anything done. i was never the perfect student. my grades were bad. i had no faith in myself. i thought i could not do anything right. i never accomplished anything. the only thing i could accomplish is messing up everything. school, at home, in a public area, anywhere. i made bad choices back in my pass; but now its completed",2.5,3.0,4.0,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.5932695865631104,3.329840898513794,3.332881212234497,3.4707276821136475,3.4081990718841553,3.3277342319488525
"cellphones should be allowed because that might help students to communicate with their parents if they have any kind of emergency while they are in school. it would be helpful for students to find any kind of information on internet when they forget their computers or other devices that they might use as a resource to find information. another reason is that students will have the advantage to use their cellphones while they are in the middle of the class, and it means that those schools trust students that they use their cellphones properly during class and they are proving to others schools that student can be trusted to use their cellphones during classes. students also can give an example to other students that cellphones are little machines that help us in everyday lives, and they also might be giving advice to students in how they can be benefited from chance that the school provides to them. on the other side why cellphones should not be allowed in schools is because schools think that students will not use their cellphones in a right path, and they will become more addictive to their cellphones where social media it s included. most of the population have shown that a big percent of the population use their cellphones to spend their time in social media, whether is facebook, twitter, and instragram. another percent of the population spend their time in youtube which that youtube brings us some advantage and disadvantage. the advantage might be the tutorials that can help us to find information, how to fix something that you are capable to repair, and how to provide some skills from something that you like. the disadvantage might be that people might spend too much time watching video games or a new episodes from their favorite comics characters. another reason to not use cellphones in school is because when there is a fight between two students, they start to take pictures or videos of the fight rather than prevent and called anyone who can help. most of the student will agree to have cellphones in schools because some of them use their cellphones in a right path and some of them do not. for those who use their cellphones in a properly way will say that cellphones are going to help them more than what teachers expect. some of this students also will help them to find whatever meaning of a word that they do not understand. there are going to be some students who speak different language as their first language and it is very helpful to have cellphone while they are in school. for example some of the students who speak spanish and they do not understand what the word say, they directly go to their cellphones and translate the word. then they start to use it in some sentences to challenge themselves and improve their english. those students who agree to have cellphones in school and do not accomplish the rules in how to use their cellphones properly, they will be playing around",4.0,3.5,4.0,4.0,3.5,4.0,3.8156371116638184,3.5800113677978516,3.6179919242858887,3.839487314224243,3.5149807929992676,3.7235360145568848

"yes, i do agree with former british prime minister winston churchill s statement, because people do fail over and over again without loosing enthusiasm. i have good enthusiasm. for example i failed a lot of classes in high school and i had to repeat them i gave all of my best effort on every class i had to take even if i wasn t good at it or if i didn t like it because i don t want to keep repeating them just because i didn t try i have great confidence on every skill i have and i always try to improve them in a better way i ask for help to see what i need improve on and i eventually did get better and it was worth it because it made things much easier i understood all of the problems i had trouble with i brought my grades up on the class i was failing on i mostly got b s on the tests and quizzes it s way better than getting a d i was glad that i was making changes and improvement on my skills it was the best thing i have ever done. i have dont ever give up, for example one time i remember i had to do make a little video game for my school project and as i was making it i didn t know what kind of video game to make i didn t have any ideas of what to make and i thought of giving up because i didn t know what to make and then i started thinking of making a first person shooting game and it was mostly like the game call of duty but i made a little change to it i put in the choices to choose any gun from the previous games it can be a gun from any call of duty game i feel like that was a good idea because some people would really like to have some of the old weapons back and they like a game that is boots on the ground and i also made a zombie game mode i put in some better things in that mode and i kept adding more details to the game and i am actually glad that i didn t give up because it tells me that i am not a quitter and that i wont be giving up so easily. some people would disagree with winston churchill statement because they dont believe that failure would consist to success they think that if you fail your gonna fail again over and over no matter how hard you try your always gonna fail i know some people say that because i had a friend that literally gave up so fast it was pretty sad and i kept telling him that you have to keep trying there s no other choice you can do but push yourself and he didn t he just gave up and didn t even bother to try. however not everyone gives up",3.5,3.5,3.0,4.0,3.5,3.0,3.4511630535125732,3.263305425643921,3.162719249725342,3.45471453666687,3.172605037689209,3.207681655883789

"on september , generic_name was entering his first year of high school, and already knew what he wanted to do with his life, and that was to be a doctor, but was having trouble on what kind of doctor he wanted to be. so he decided to do some research on what kind of doctor he wanted to be before entering high school. finally, generic_name decided he wanted to be, a surgeon. took all of the classes he needed to be one. few years later, became a surgeon, making lots of money, living in a nice house, and is living the best life he could dream of. in some societies, students are expected to identify a career by the time they enter high school. personally i think they should identify a career by the time they enter high school. so they can have the opportunities on what they need to do to get the job and not to be stressed out too much. those are the reasons why they should commit to a career by the time they get to high school. the first reason why they should identify a career by the time they enter high school is to have opportunities on what you need to get the job. in order to get the job, you need to go check out some places on what they do, so then you would know what to do. the other opportunity you have is you would know what classes you would need to take. for example, if you want to be a history teacher you basically just have to take most of the history classes, or if you want to be doctor you would basically take all sciene classes. the other opportunity is that if you want to make a lot of money have a plan set up. that s the reason why you should identify a career by the time you enter high school to have opportunities on what you need to get the job. the second reason why they should identify a career by the time they enter high school is, so they don t get stressed out too much. if you know what you want to do then you re fine because the more you know the less stress you ll be in. if you know what you want to do then you ll be able to know what classes you will need to take, so then you won t have to take extra classes for no reason. also if you need help don t hesitate to ask because everyone is here to help. the more you ask for help the less you ll be stressed. that s the reason why they should identify a career by the time they enter high school, so they don t get stressed out too much. some people would disagree with me because they think it s ok to wait to identify a career before they enter high school. they say that because they think high school is a place where you just hang out",4.0,3.5,3.5,4.0,3.5,4.0,3.868581533432007,3.8419687747955322,3.989636182785034,4.103626251220703,3.9428117275238037,3.899151563644409

"winston churchill once said ""success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm"", meaning success can only be achieved by having few mistakes along the way. many believe achieving success means doing everything perfect and not making one single mistake, having a couple of mistakes doesn t mean failure it means progress to be successful because one can learn from the mistakes that are made and helps improve to achieve something better. to be successful, there will be some mistakes in the journey but when those mistakes are made learning from them is the best way to accomplish your goal. for example, when one is constructing a house but have little knowledge on construction, the one building the house will mess up and fail at times but the best way to finish something is to learn from what went wrong. to clarify, to accomplish a certain goal, learning from the mistakes along the journey is the best way to do it. not only learning from mistakes help be successful but it also helps improve one another. improvement is a big key in success. failure will always have a role in success but it happens to help improve to become or do something better. for example, famous altheles in sports make mistakes in games all the time, but from the failures in the past, pro altheles train to improve more to become better and to not make the same mistakes again. in other words, failure may be the worse but it s a way to show what to improve. from mistakes made in the past one will become better or do better than expected. having a couple of mistakes doesn t mean failure it means progress to be successful. failure will play an important role during the journey of success but you learn from mistakes and improve to be better, success isn t perfect, the little mistakes along the way are actually the things that make one get to the top and become successful.",4.0,3.5,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.5,3.706754446029663,3.7279696464538574,3.768974781036377,4.007372856140137,3.649733066558838,3.8117940425872803
"technology seems to be becoming more and more important now. as the technology improves year by year, some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. but people have very different thoughts to this idea, then the problem comes. would students benefit from being able to attend classes from home? although some think students should attend classes from home, actually they shouldn t attend classes from home because students might be doing other things during the online class time. and students would get less opportunities to communicate with their friends if they attend classes from home. those who believe students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home have their reasons. they think it s much safer for students to take an online class at home. and they also believe it might be better for students to study under a quite environment. one reason of why students shouldn t attend classes from home is that they might be doing other things during the online class time. an example of this would be my cousin, generic_name. he took an online class on the computer few months ago. in the beginning, he was so exciting because it was the first time for him to take a class at home. and his parents were happy to see that because it s difficult to send generic_name to school everyday, both of them had work to do. after a few weeks, generic_name got his first test grade of online study. it was much lower than the grade he used to get. i asked the reason later, he explained he was playing his cell phone during the class time and didn t pay attention. if he normally took classes in the school, i thought he would get at least a ""b"" in this test. he was smart,just too lazy to study. it s undeniable that online classes brought a lot of convinces to generic_name and his family, but it was not the best way to help him to improve his grade. another reason of why students shouldn t attend classes from home is that students would get less opportunities to communicate with their friends. an example of this would be my friend, generic_name. although he wasn t like to talk, he had a lot of friends in the school because he was nice to everyone. but everything has changed, since he attended classes from home . we didn t see him for a long time even the class was over. his parents told us he won t come to school anymore because he hated school. if generic_name took classes at school like before, he would meet more friends. i can t say if it s a bad choice to attend classes from home, but at least not the way for those students who wasn t like to talk. in conclusion, although some think students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home, i believe students shouldn t attend classes from home.",4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.8763599395751953,4.242815971374512,4.110776424407959,4.119492053985596,3.989332675933838,4.054242134094238

"it is important to share a lesson with elementary school students because, as they get older they can know what they have learned when they were younger. elementary school students learn way more when someone is teaching them a lesson instead of the kids learning it by there self. teaching kids a lesson in school or out of school is not a bad thing to do because kids and others can learn anything out of school walls, once they start go grow up they will understand what they have learn and what not have learn in elementary school, and of the hard effort the kids have put into there work in school and at home. why is giving a lesson to elementary schools important ? i feel like it is important because your teaching them something they have not learned or know about what they will be learning about yet, teaching younger kids can be really nice and all, but some of these kids can be very hard to take care of and handle like upper up classes/grades. when giving a lesson to a class can be difficult and all that, but it can also be fun to teach them some cool things they should know about and teach them easy work so they can understand the work faster and so they can see what level or understatement they are at, kids that go to elementary school can be way easier and faster to teach because upper grade level can get hard and exhausted, cause of there beavers and they way they love to act in front of other people which, they shouldnt be acting like that. younger students know better then not to behave really bad and act crazy, thats why i think it is important to teach younger kids then older kids, younger students they well ,they know what they are doing, also understand of the the work we teach them but we always got to teach them very well and help them with the lesson we have given and show how it is done and how to do it with out being upset.",3.0,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.5,3.289767026901245,3.0282809734344482,3.0248496532440186,3.259366273880005,2.957231283187866,3.0434703826904297

"thomas jefferson wrote, ""determine never to be idle it is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing""? i believe, when most of the people don t understand how relevant is to do something instead of being inactivity that also serve purpose because like everybody else it is normal to always do or make good things for someone, and it could be family or close friends for example. my reason is if we try to done good stuff for people, and not receiving anything back for example: if i give people chance to not try anything, then how are we gonna communicate? how are we going to accomplish our goal when you don t deserve it? so my point and my reason is the we need to do something about not being inactivity with people are around you. i understand that not everyone are gonna have the same thoughts as me or with other person. however we need to be on the side to the change for good. i grew up knowing when people put a lot of their afford to you, it means a lot because you ll never know when people will trust you and believe in you again it s a huge difference between those, and we people show us or make us see how important is when almost everything is easy when we ask for it example: trying to hard to show how many things you have done for that person without asking, but it means a lot to you because you give a lot to that person and you hope that person can give you the same thing you ve done for her or him. sometimes some people misunderstood about always doing something for her or him like you don t have to do it for them, but believe you ll feel great if someone do something for you isn t a bad thing then you will be fine and grateful knowing that theres good people around you, and ready for help you. you ain t alone anymore believe theres people for you and try to not think too much about it. my conclusion is about to always do something for people because there is people who will need you, and being around, and everything you want to do for them it will make it better like. thomas jefferson wanted to do good stuff as a president caring about his people, and making him one of the best presidents, so it is wonderful to done much for them than yourself.",2.0,2.5,3.0,2.0,2.5,2.5,3.413893461227417,3.1617422103881836,3.2361068725585938,3.38714861869812,3.234860897064209,3.253150224685669
"thomas jefferson said enjoy your life for as long a you can what is a enjoyable way to spend time outdoors? a lot of people like to go outside and spend their time because its fun and they wants to enjoy their life. there is a lot of places that people can spend their time for ex: community park, state parks, and national parks. there is thousand of people that cant go outside because they have to do work or their busy. their is a lot of places where people can go and spend their time outdoors for example: national parks, and museum etc. their is a lot of fun things to do in a nation park or museum. in the museum there is a lot of old things to see for example: a dinousor bone or a bone of some old animal that dosent exist these day. their is a lot of places that have been made for people to come and check it out and enjoy everything. the reason people find that activity enjoyable because there is al ot of cool stuff to do, and its just fun for them and that what they are interested on. their is a lot of people that like different kinds of things. for example one guy likes to go to a park and another guy like to go to a museum. there is some people that dosent like to go to the park or other places. because they just dont enjoy it. a lot of people like to go outside and spend their time because its fun and they wants to enjoy their life. their is a lot of places that people can find interested for example: community park, state parks, and national parks. there is a lot of people that goes to national park with their family because they all can enjoy it and have a fun day. there is some people that dosent like to go to the park or other places. because they just dont enjoy it. all of us are different and everybody likes different kind of things.",2.5,3.0,2.5,3.0,3.0,2.5,3.032430410385132,2.913998603820801,2.9444098472595215,3.051506996154785,2.859575033187866,2.952164649963379
"do we choose our own behavior or is it controlled by other influences. well it all has to depend on the type of person you are. for example if you are somebody who gets influenced by other people then you are going to act like those people. and usually those people are bad influences, but if you are somebody that chooses to be who they are then that is really who they are. and mostly it is to be nice to others, and those are some reasons why it can go either way, but for me i personally think you have a choice to be who you desire to be without any influeces. when you get to be who you want to be life is easier. you are going to be true to yourself and people will have respect for you. and many people all over the world are scared to be themselfs, and would rather get controlled by other people. and because of those type of people they spread that nagative influence off to other people that get controlled easily. but in the end it depends on who you hang around with. choosing the way you act is very important not just for you but for your future. because your future is what matters at the end of the day. and because of that reason is because if you want to find a good job you have to be respectful and kind. but if you didn t have a good attitude then nobody won t hire you. it s reasonable too, because nobody wants a bad attitude person in their jobs. many people who have chose their characters have been successful because of it. and cause they have confedenced they can achieve anything they want in the world. and all that just because they went on to be themselfs. meanwhile those who have been influenced by others have been stuck like that their whole lifes. depending on what type of influences they get, because some are good and they get to high places in life. so at the end of the day as long as you choose something that is good for you and won t take you to bad places you will be great in life. but unfortunally it usually ends in bad places for those who are weak and would rather take influences by others who are in bad situations. and thats why for me it is better to choose to be yourself then to follow others. but if you are somebody that likes the influences then choose people who are good. that is how i see it in my eyes.",3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.668144702911377,3.499206781387329,3.640444755554199,3.6084392070770264,3.5412914752960205,3.611342430114746
"people who value self-reliance define dependence. following your own instincts and making your own decisions is the whole point of life in my opinion. it makes a person more independent and trustworthy. also, helps a person learn from own mistakes. a person will always have guidance. whether its from parents, teachers, police officers, or even a person you dont even know can give you some type of guidance. it always goes back on how the individual is going to view it. independence is very important. having full control and capability of standing alone can make a person realize what is best for them. also, not being easily influenced can help a lot. understanding what is best for you can make your decisions much easier. people need to learn from their own mistakes. mistakes happen every day. a persons instincts may not always be right but it will benefit them in the future. another person is not going to tell you something you want to hear or give you the assurance you need for something. they may think they know whats best for you but personally for you, it could not be the best. knowing yourself and knowing how you like things to be done is another example of self-reliance. seeking guidance from experts and authorities can be the right thing to do. it can save a person from debating too much on a decision. help a person plan better for the future and not really let the person struggle. as well, as to prevent the individual to stress out of what not knowing to do. however, a persons own instincts and ideas is what makes the person value self-reliance. and know whats best for them. who knows you better than you? to conclude, its all about self perspective. on how you view things for yourself and your future. being independent and not rely on others opinions. having your own thoughts and opinions. accepting that making mistakes is okay not everything has to be right and perfect.",4.5,4.0,4.5,4.5,3.5,4.0,3.8379054069519043,3.876589298248291,3.901041030883789,4.042942523956299,3.8243815898895264,3.8890044689178467
"i agree with first impressions are almost impossible to change, because this is one of the things that only happend one time, well it can happend again, but not at the same way than the first one. so you can not change it because that is what you felt at the moment when you experienced this feeling in your life and you will not want to change it because you liked what you felt and you might probably want to repeat it again. then it is like when you see someone on the street or in the city that is wearing completely different clothe or extrange clothes than you or than everybody around you, and he or she inmediatly is catching everybody s attention, because probably they never have seen someone like them before or they not normally used to see people wearin like that. sometimes people might probably start talking about them like given own opinions, or some people just judge them because of their dreasing, others just are corious because they might probably want to know something about this people because they or their culture seem interested to them and the want to experience sort of activities with this people or have fun with them. constantly people experience this kind of impressions, because they normally are around so many people like their family, their friends, or even with people they not even not at all. so that make them to experienced this type of circunstances and because of that, is that they are exposed to experience this feelings at any time or anywhere. it do not matter because you going to see so many things and those things are going make you feel this way. inmediatly it do not matter where you go or where you are with, you are going to experience this, even with yourself bacause this always happend and you will want to go and to be talking of that with your friends or you might be probably get a clue and put it like an example and your life. sometimes first impressions help you to be even better in life, because you will be thinking about it and you might start making something different on you because you saw something special on someone which you got first impression. in conclusion first impressions normally will be impossible to change, bacause it is unique and you can not change that. you might can change the way you think of it and probably if you experience it again it will not be the same because you will know what it is already, and it will be like it is not making sense and you will wondering the reason why is this happening. sometimes first impressions will help you to understand people or their kind of life they have, it do not matter the race because people have something different something that we might need.",3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.5,3.258498191833496,3.2108359336853027,3.2105443477630615,3.2695400714874268,3.1476006507873535,3.2296292781829834

"although it may seen that ""unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow"" it actually right. but having something that you master it doesn t mean that trying something new you would failed. but giving up it s what would cost you to never grow, for example changing your life style by eating right and going to the gym is not going to be easy but you still going to give it a try. the reason why is that we want to challenge our self in a new environment that we never thought our self would be challenge our self in. another reason would be that trying something new mean that we are looking for something that we would enjoy or like. for example we teach our self how to cook but we know that we never knew how to cook but that doesn t mean we are not going to give it a try. that why we try new things because we want to challenge our self in a situation that we never knew that we could solve it or give up. another reason is that we love trying new things because we are curious if we can master it another example would be is raising a kid wondering if we got everything and teaching them what is right and what is wrong. that what we love trying new things to see if we can do it or not. that what is more important trying new things and see if we can master it because we are capable of doing thing not a computer can t do and that it trying to learn new things. we can master anything in our way because we are willing to find out if we can do this, if can not fear it, if we got this, give our self ideas that anything we do it possible when we put our mind it nothing can t stop us. for example we got our freedom from england long time ago, we ended slaves, and we ended racism which was big in the united state. those are the reason why we can master things even if they are hard to master but we do it for a reason, and the reason is that we love to try new things even is bad but every challenge we are giving, we master them. but there is no dough we would failed those challenge that the world has giving us. mastering is a challenge that is difficult because there is in our lifetime were we give up and we don t want it anymore. were our mind and our body just doesn t want it, doesn t keep trying, at some point we start calling our selves looser, quitter. we bring ourselves down because that how we punish ourselves without physical pain but emotion pain. in our life time that we have live in this earth the most pain that brought us down was emotional pain when we give up in life",3.0,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.0,3.0,3.0483591556549072,2.8245866298675537,2.7716445922851562,2.9637534618377686,2.8631882667541504,2.795464038848877

"i would have to disagree to this statements. letting be controlled by the world (people) it s not a good idea. there is so many things to accomplish, by not being controlled by other people. we can so many things without people controlling us, we can succeed our life. we can actually be someone though our hard work and deduction. being us: just being who you are would be the best and great choice to do. you would think properly with correct knowledge, just by doing that, you would accomplish so many things in life without people going agents you. not being you or being someone you really not are, is not a good idea. don t let them control you: letting people control who you are, isn t a good thing. many people think is a good thing because they can fame or attention, its like having a double life, : living the regular life, being who you really are, : being out in public pretending to be someone when your not. you won t accomplish the things you want to do when your not yourself. you will feel important when the world wants you be someone. be yourself and accomplish the things you want to do and you will improve your skills and achivments. they will just control your life and they won t help you on the long run. no one can control someones life who they want them to be. being us, not them: we need let people do what they want we shouldn t be controlling their life. everyone should chose there who they want to be and what to do. not everyone should be controlling them. not everyone are they same, they are different from others. they don t know their weaknesses to be telling them to be. we shouldn t be controlling other people what to become. many people do it for the fame and attention but they are the most unsuscceful people. they dont achieve things they go by there fame and people. we should be us and not be someone we cant be. they end up being embarrassed.",2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,3.503635883331299,3.2555336952209473,3.252117872238159,3.3522379398345947,3.122007131576538,3.200927257537842
"first impressions is what the person show you. the first impression is almost impossible to change. in my opinion i m agree with this statement. some people can think in a diffent way for they experiences. most peoples can think the same way that i think. people can change with time not at the first impression when you meet someone. people can deside is they want to know the person better. people can change in there own way, or if they really want to change they need to deside to be better in life. the first impression is impossible to change. they need time,effort, and dedication to change. most people can said that you do not need all those things to cange. the people at the fist impression. the first impression is what the person make you feel. the first impression is what the person show you. the person can not change at the first impression, they most need to have the specific time to change. one of the most important fact to change is time. for example, is a person is fighting with a employee at the ice cream story, you can not can change that person that way the he think. maybe you must wants that. he need to realise what he is doing is something wrong .the person most have his reason for the fight. the person need time to change not at the firt moment the you meet. most people can determine that they need time to cange. another example of that is someone have a really bad adiction to do someting that do not have none benefict for his life. you most want to change that person. the first impression that this person make in you most be the most terrible impression. first impression is impossible to change. first impression is actually what the person make in you. sometimes is not the best impression that the person make .sometimes you must want to change that at the same moment even is you do not know the person. the person can change with effort is you talk to the person and let her know that what is doing is not right. maybe the person can change but not at the first impression that need take time. for example is a student is copy in a test and you realize what the student is doing you must want to change the way the he is thinking. the student need to have effort and act of actitude that he can do anything in life and have the effort to do it .another example of that is you meet someone for the first ime in the attitude is so bad you most want to tell the people to change. the person need to have the effort to change is the person wants that. the first impression are almost imposible to change. first impression is what the person show you. some people are more complicate they do not want to any effort to change. the first impression is the way the you",3.5,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.0,2.5,3.2070791721343994,3.015767812728882,2.9790873527526855,3.220393657684326,3.004169464111328,3.003692388534546
"today world, everything start to moving forward. people start to invent the new ideas and those ideas make life more easily. in medical world, people make a new kind of medicine to cure the disease, compare to the old world a lot of people had die. in technology world, people put those ideas into the physical objects that it is so important for today life. from all we see everything is start from the ideas and who invent the idea? this is the kind of the question that no one ever ask. it is us the people that invent the idea. people can make a change to the world if they start to think or we can call the attitude. the attitude of the people have a big impact to the surrounding. but not all the attitude have a good impact to the world it also have a bad impact. this is led to one of the controversial question from the science; that said do you agree or disagree that a positive attitude is the key to success in life. from my perception i agree that the positive attitude is the key to success in life because it make a people have a good communication in the community between people and people, make us being more productive on everything we do, developed our self and also things surround us quickly. everyday people need to make a connection to one another. and exchange the information from that connection. but the important thing is the way we thinking. like in the school, there are a lot of student from different place and family. but some student is isolate and other is sociable. most people think that the isolate student mostly are bad and the sociable student mostly are good. the reason that the student being isolated because there is something in the school that student can not accept so they become isolated. it kind like when you move from place to place you try to fit yourself in. it take time for them to being sociable like other student. this is not the reason for us to think that the isolate student have a negative attitude. and also not all the sociable student have a positive attitude. we can learn from the past that thing happen in high school led the student to commit suicide. the student that have a negative attitude like to bullying other student and left them no choice. for the student that commit suicide also have a negative attitude because they take the outside source seriously then them self. this is the small example that we can compare for what the meaning of the word attitude is. people like to say that most millionaire are a bad person. we can not believe in this conventional wisdom. people sometime said the bad thing to other to make them self look good. but from what i see most millionaire have a good attitude because it led them to being more productive. productive person is the person that you should be friend with.",4.0,4.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,4.0,3.1339869499206543,2.9526498317718506,2.7990169525146484,3.059910535812378,2.8595995903015137,2.881645441055298
no i do not think that we should add one hour and a half to school. i think it is bad anough that we have to stay for about hours i have a lot of reasons why i think they should not add an hour to school. one of the reasons i would not want them to add an hour to school is because if they add an hour to school they would have to add class to the chool to. but one of the main resons that i would not want another hour at school is becuase kids just want to go home and adding an hour would just get kids and parents mad for there kids getting home late. for example if it was day light savings time it would be very dark once every one to go home. or if a teacher staff memeber or student plays a sport they would be late or unbkle to go for the late releas at the school. in addition if there where to be a lockdown at that hour and a half that the school bored had added the parents of the students might want to sue the school bored for putting there children in danger at the time they added to the day. another example is if ther is a fire they could get sued for the same thing that is why i feel like the school bored should not add an hour and a half to the school day.,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.5,2.0,2.8849167823791504,2.693544387817383,2.779951333999634,2.855339765548706,2.610541343688965,2.7163093090057373
"i agree with emerson s statement about individuality ""to be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplisehment"" because of success,being yourself,and being the owner of you life. first success is the most important thing for the sociaty because we all need great people like philantropist who help reducing povrety in the world,great inventor who creat thing tahat today we cannot live whith out it such as car,internet,and computer. and the evolution of human being by creating a safe enviroment for everyone to live a long and healthy life. secondly being yourself is a great accomplishment because you truely the person you want to be, you are true to the people around you being showing them who you really are by acting truely without faking who you are,and you are live a meaninfull live by being yourself instead of what the world want you to be. thirdly being the owner of you life is really important because you can your own decide, you can decide what kind of futur you want ,and being able to make this decisision by yourself will make you life greatfull,and mostly an healthy live. some people will said that is worthless or is better to be told what to do,but being able to creat your success,being yourself,and being the owner of you life is somthing really important for the development of human life and for every individu to dicide what they want to be or what they have plan for they futur. all this will drive a person to a great accomplishment because life is a text and every individu have a different text so being yourself in this world will always be a great accomplishment because some people a conditioner to live the live that the world gave them.",2.5,2.0,2.5,2.5,2.0,2.0,2.93654203414917,2.693647623062134,2.6593875885009766,2.8883378505706787,2.6478724479675293,2.6558213233947754
"in today s world we accomplish many things by being active, and doing them. if we would like to achieve or accomplish something we have to be dedicated and actually try not just be inactive because this awesome life we have if full of amazing experiences. many of us go to high school, or have jobs that we to attend and we are expected to try our best which would benefit us. being inactive or not doing something right could lead to getting fired or failing in school which is why inactivity is known for negative results. the way we accomplish is not on how smart we are, or what people tell us to do is on if we are willing to try and keep on doing it. in the other hand inactivity may give you the time to rest at home, catch up on things but it wouldn t get you nowhere because your not being productive. for example, if your trying to get a job theres always competition for that position, the manager might want to pick the other person simply because his resume, he has involve himself in way more things like clubs and also because his ability of proving hes way better than the other person. which is why its all about doing something so you can succeed in life rather than just sitting there and then later having the time to have fun. lastly, the best feeling of accomplishing something is the reward, or enjoying what you have earned. for example, i am expected to do many things around the house like cleaning, feeding the dog, and even babysitting. even though sometimes i dont want to do it, i end up accomplishing more than what i have to do because i am the type of person that likes being known for accomplishing things around the house and then having to enjoy that feeling of my parents being proud of me. being inactive wouldn t result in a positive result to many people including me because you arent gaining anything from it. im sure everyone loves that deep feeling when you have done something right and you get something out of it. not many people know how wonderful it is if we are always doing something and how it can really benefit you, even on the smallest things. in conclusion, people should consider always doing something even if it s something small because anyone can tell you being inactive isnt the way to live life or be. after all, the accomplishments you earned will really show off in the long run thanks to always doing something.",4.0,4.0,3.5,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.8885207176208496,3.88625168800354,3.9327354431152344,3.8690671920776367,3.8005871772766113,3.848599433898926
"in some occasion you feel weary or oppress to think about that you have to take high school during -years when you know that you can do in -years? some school districts are thinking is this wonderful ides to offer a programs to the students that they can graduate in -years, the school districts should be approve the idea to graduate in -years because it will be so helpful to the students to feel more motivate to graduate early, the students will use the other year to work and make money to pay some par of their career, and the students can enter and start college one year early . the students will feel more motivate to graduate early becasue many students that come from middle school they really took class of high school like algebra , geometry, earth science, history ect, they can easely graduate and -years. i have two brothers older than i my brother that is -years-old he graduate in -years he miss only one class, but he take during summers because the school have the programs to high school students graduate in -years. also some school districts don t offer this program to graduate in -years and the students lose their motivation to graduate and who want to go to school just for one class a whole year, what happed if a student miss only one class to graduate in year,but the school districts don t have the programs and the student have to come for a whole year just for want class like my older brother that is -years-old he only miss one class to graduate in -years but the school from california did not have the programs to leave him graduate in -years it was so bad for him and a lot of students past the same thing. the student will able to use the other year to work and make money to pay a part of their career, we know that a lot of students don t have parents that can pay for their career because is a lot of money that they have to pay for a career, this year off will be so fundamental to the students who don t have the help enough to pay their career. during this year they can work and make money and have the opportunity to enter a college and be some one in life. the students who are a school don t have the time enough to get a work outside and pay their career through a work. this is why a lot of students who graduate from high school don t take a career because they don t have the money to pay it, or their parents don t have money to help them, i have a lot of friends and family who finished high school but they did not take a career because they did not have the money enough to pay it, and what happed if you want to take a career, but you don t have the money enough to take it.",3.5,2.5,3.0,2.5,3.0,3.5,2.9034807682037354,2.758659601211548,2.6647543907165527,2.875915765762329,2.6860151290893555,2.782343626022339
"for a student like me, working in a group is alot better than working by my by self. here is some reasons why working in a group is better than working alone. number one we finish the assignement alot faster. number two everyone is working on something different. number three everyone is helping each other if we struggling on something. there is the bad part about working in a group is that there is alot of distration, there is also different ideas that everyone wants to put in the assignment. now lets look at the good part on woekinmg on the assignment alone. number one there is no distractions getting in between you working. number two there is only your idea on how you want it to look like. number three you can ask the teacher on how sheor he wants the assignment to be done, so that means that the assignment is going to be correctly done. the bad part on working alone is that there is going to take more time on the assignment to be done. the other part is that is that you have to do all the wrok by your self and have to rely on your self. other words if you pick to work in a group or by your self, are going to be struugling kinda the same thing like how mush work you have to finish, the different ideas on how you wnat it to be looking linke or how you want it to be done. ones again for a student like me i rather work in a group than by myself because knowing my self i wont finish my work or the assingment. in a group i can have one part on the assignment that i have to finish. you can say i am picking on working in a group to do less work, and you are right because its going to be done instead of not doing the whole assignment. so for my coclusion i would want to work in a group instead of working alone because ""team work makes the deam work.""",3.5,3.0,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.1957216262817383,3.006047487258911,3.193208932876587,3.195301055908203,3.017033576965332,3.052931308746338
"i think that no matter if you are taking online classes, or going to school, you always going to graduate you can loarn alot if you r taking online classes. like if i were on the position of taking online classes, because im working and i don t have that much time i would loved to study when ever i could. for example: some people that are here in the united states they have to go to school and work after school, and they got to pay rent, send money to their families back in there contries. for example: some of the people don t have someone that can take them to school and the school is far away that the buses can not go all the way to their homes. for example: there are some kids that don t go to school, having the school next to them, but there s alot of people out here thet would love to go to school or even take online classes but they can t because some of them are always working, some of them even have two jobs. for example: my mom wouold loved to take online classes at less but she can t because she has to work in the very morning like at am, and she comes back like at one she cleans the house and then like at pm she goes to her other job and she gets out like at : pm so she doesn t have time but she would love if she could do it. for example: my dad he s going all the way to dc for school because he is taking classes for duster he pays each moth and my dad works to in countruction but weekends she goes to dc the classes start like at and they end like at , if you like someting work hard for what you like. for example: i have a friend that he takes online he work s everyday, he takes his computer to his work so when he s on break runs to the computer and he starts school online like that someone that wants to progress in this country.",2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,3.0,3.0,2.9332387447357178,2.745783805847168,2.7381303310394287,2.93599796295166,2.7458560466766357,2.797271966934204
"do you remember when you decided what you wanted to be? your character will be what yourself choose to make it .do we choose our own character traits,or is our caracter formed by in fluences beyond our control. i agree your character will be what you yourself choose to make it. because, you make your own desicions,you take responsability,and you have goals. however many,believe that people influence the way we choose our characters because they think they have the rigth to critize the way people decides. actually,this is a bad idea because people makes their own decisions,in society most of the time we have to take a decision whether are rigth or wrong we must take it at some point but is also,your choice to make the best out of it. for example,my brother had to take a decision by himself which was doing something in life going to collage study or work as an mcdonals co-worker he decided the best was going to collage and keep studying. if,my brother wouldn t have taken that decision then he had lost an opportunity to make it. the second reason your character will be what your self choose to make it, is that you take responsability because taking responsabilities make a better character of your self. for example,when you wake up early just to be on time at work every day you feel you are giving the best of you yourself are choosing to make your character. if,you are not giving the best of you every day that means you are no choosing to make your own character. the third reason your character will be what your self choose to make it,is that you have goals because you want to feel satified when you have achieve something important in your life. for example,when getting your first bachelor degree when getting your dream job or you worked so hard for your dream car you always wanted. if, you don t have goals to follow then you are no going to make it. in conclusion,make your own path,you are encharge,and you have dreams to follow.",3.0,4.0,3.0,3.5,3.5,2.5,3.3234519958496094,3.1641244888305664,3.223099708557129,3.2758939266204834,3.1800034046173096,3.138507843017578

"many people believe that the infulences from others make us change on who we are, i believe that. growing up we all had good and bad infulences at school, home, or in any other place. as a kid, every little thing you see or hear; you copy. thats why you have to be careful what happens around kids, because it may affect them later on in life. for an example, when parents argue infront of there kids its tramatizing and they may learn from that. once there all grown up they can either be better then there parents or exactly the same or even worse, all because they were influenced by there parents arguments. its not only just the arguments but when parents are abusive towards each other or when parents hit there childern, even the use of drugs, it will affect the child later on. kids believe that because someone else did it, its okay for them to be able to do it too; and thats not right. as a parent, it is very important to talk to your childern at a young age about the right way and the wrong way. every parent wants the best for their child, they dont want to see them make misakes or anything. as a teenager we think its annoying or we think they dont understand the way were feeling, but thats not true. they give us advice and ground us when we do the wrong thing because they don t want us to go through any of that again. they were once teenagers too and they already went through what were going through. they just want the best for us, because half of the time they couldn t be succesful and they want you to be able to grow up and have the things they were not able to get you. another example could be the different types of infulences at school. theres always gonna be the good kids and the bad kids, you just gotta see which side is gonna lead you into a better future. the good influences will want the best for you, for you to continue school, to not do drugs, to not do anything ilegal, ect. on the other hand, the bad kids will want you to ditch school, do drugs, do ilegal things, because as to them its all ""fun"". it may seem fun but there are consequences when you do the wrong thing. as a teenager you already have to have an idea on what you wanna do later on in life. half the teens don t know, because there stuck in a world where it invloves, parties, alcohol, drugs, sex, ect. when your stuck in a world like that, its very hard to get out. being influenced by friends is very easy. of all the times you guys hang out and everthing, it starts to change you; from being well influenced or bad influenced. perperssure is the reason alot of us take the wrong lane in life. your friends can convince you of doing something",4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.5,3.5,3.5685417652130127,3.526637077331543,3.547694444656372,3.531405210494995,3.4868838787078857,3.5386617183685303
generic_name todays technology allows people to do many different tasks without having contact with others in a positive way. technology today is now making it easier for us humans to do things and also showing us what the furture could look like in a couple of years. why would this be a negative thing ? if people are just trying to make are lives easier. for an example lets say you need to get some where but fast and you don t have a ride there is now a app where you send your location and give the address to place you need to go and somebody will take you. technology is such a great thing and its becoming greater each and everyday. there are many different types of apps that you can download on your phone today for anything. lets say that your at home and your really hungry but you don t want to leave the house you can download an app called grubhub that will make sure you dont miss a meal. what is grubhub its an app that delivers food from anywhere. all you do is tell the person what you want to eat the location of the place to pick up the food and your address so they know where to drop it off. and its that easy this thing that we call a phone can make all this happen with a little bit of typing. these apps are for free too but it may cost for the food but not everything is free in life. computers are also a big part of technology. computers and laptops are used everyday could be for school for work for anything. computers help out a lot in school for anyone who needs to do research and any type of information he or she did not know about. laptops are great aswell its a computers that folds and is for on the go great for anyone that travels a lot or somebody that works on computers alot. laptops are becoming better everyday there are even touch screen ones some that fold backwards and its crazy to think about because what do you think is going to happen a couple years from now technology is perparing us for the furture. technology is making our lives easir each and everyday. with out technology i wouldn t be able to take this take i wouldn t be able to the police if i m in danger. its a great use for us humans this will never be a negative thing to me. we need technology in our lives so we know whats going on around us. technology is a use and it always will be.,3.5,3.0,4.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.39448618888855,3.2656891345977783,3.2785186767578125,3.3247148990631104,3.2084431648254395,3.193189859390259

"imagine how life would feel like when you can t have your favorite food at your favorite spot in school? would it even be fun to go to school or not. about a week or two ago i went to panda express to grab some food on my way home but at the time that i got there, i asked to get some white rice with some orange chicken but the workers told me they have changed their menu a little bit so i can t have some,at that point i fell so sad because that was the only spot that sold some in town. i think the change of the school menu would be a bad idea because,it will make students leave the school ground to go get some food in a illegal way,it would also bring some money problems in school and it would also make some students keep on empty stomach during the school day till they get home to prepare some food. secondly,if students leave the school ground to go get some food in a illegal way andthey never came back, this would leave the parents worried because since the principal decided to change the menu they would have a reason for leaving school ground. mr. principal i would be happy to tell you to leave the menu like how it is because it would make some students get in trouble and a lot of incidents will happen when they leave. nce a bad incident happen out of the school ground,the principal would be responsible for all the damages caused when they left, keeping the old menu would be a good idea but we don t want our accidents and school detentions to increase. in addition to this it would cause some money problems because if students are going to have to eat healthy then how would they gain more money easily to support the school when they are in needs of something. this is some of the way you can make more money so, mr principal if you decide to change it the school is going to have to shut down at a point because when is no money to operate the school and pay the teachers and custodians they would have to leave their job and get a better one and once everyone one is gone there would be any teachers to teach the students. mr principal because of this reason we should keep the old menu so that students and teachers can enjoy their selves in the school. therefore if the principal end up using the healthy menu this will led to some students getting sick because they will have to leave their stomach empty and they can t have what they want. this will cause a protest in the county because they supposed to eat what they like, and what the cafeteria think will be good for them to eat. in case of this of this reason the teachers will teach for no reason because the student are so focused on going home to",3.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.5,3.0,3.707195997238159,3.553220510482788,3.668337106704712,3.7554757595062256,3.4538118839263916,3.564718008041382

"the decision regarding extracurricular involvement should be left to students and their family because, students know how to mange their time, families would remind or help out, and teachers give students time to finish or study assignments. as a senior in high school, i attend to many activities after school and still have plenty of time to complete assignments. i believe, that managing time is key on getting everything done on time. in the past, i have asked teachers on how i could mange my time and still have time to complete assignments. after having that conversation, i had improved my grades and also had time for activities. thats why i think managing time is a good way to complete school work and finish any outside activities. if my family were to see me go out a lot or come back late from any activity without completing my work, they would talk to me and find a way to help me out. after that, they would see my grades and check for any late assignments because, there is no family that would like for their son/daughter to have bad grades in school. many students would not pay attention on their grades and go outside thinking that they have nothing due for any classes. although, thats when families come in and remind their child that they have assignments to complete before they go outside. this is why families are good reminders and helpers on getting good grades. teachers in high school give students enough time to complete assignments or study during class. i tend to complete it during class because i like to go home and not worry about any school work. overtime if a student does not finish their homework, teachers tend to say that they gave us time to complete it during class. however, i do not make that same mistake and finish my work during class, so that the teacher would not bother me. that is why taking advantage on finishing working during class, is a good why to have time for any outside activity. that is why schools should not control any student, and regarding extracurricular involment shall be left to students and their families.",4.0,4.0,3.5,4.0,4.0,4.5,3.8828911781311035,3.8501908779144287,3.853393793106079,4.080325126647949,3.816258668899536,3.9051127433776855

"is true self-esteem caused by self-confidence or is it caused by achievement, are people right about what they believe that; self-esteem is caused by self-confidence or is self-esteem caused by achievements? self-esteem is caused by achievements, although some people may believe self-esteem is caused by ""self-confidence"". i personally believe, self-esteem is caused by someone s achievement. by personal experience my self-esteem is caused by my own achievements. true self-esteem is caused by achievements for example: we can say, an employee at chipotle has recently been elected ""employee of the month"". people may say "" what does that have to do with self-esteem?"" it does have to do with self-esteem because, that person has recently been elected employee of the month, and is being rewarded for his achievement of being elected employee of the month for his hard work. although some people may believe that; self-esteem is caused by self-confidence. i personally still believe achievement is prior to self-confidence, and it s the cause of someone s self-esteem like; being elected employee of the month, that is one feeling of satisfaction that person had for being elected employee of the month. next, it is possible that self-esteem could be caused by self-confidence. for example: there may be students that can t start off their day learning without feeling confident about themselves. they may not want to learn, because they don t feel the positive energy or enough knowledge to be able to cope with how they re feeling that day; whether they want to learn or they don t want to learn. also, for example: i have a friend who can t learn if she doesn t feel confident. she starts distracting others around her, she starts interrupting class, because it is hard for her to focus and learn when she doesn t feel confident. although some people believe in praising a student s work to build self-esteem. i still believe in achievement being prior to self-confidence. because in my opinion the second the student is done being praised; they will immediately go back to not feeling self-confident to start their day learning. finally, true self-esteem is profit to achievement. there is a vast of people around the world being praised for their achievements. achievements include; if you re being praised for something good you ve done like: getting a job, becoming employee of the month, helping someone by carrying their groceries to their car, if an elderly has tipped over in the street and need help getting up, these are the causes of true self-esteem. for example: last year at my old school, generic_school our cheer team felt true self-esteem to find out they had made it to finals. making it to cheer-leading finals was a vast achievement for them, because it had been years since our team had won finals. in conclusion, true self-esteem is caused by achievement. by personal experience i can conclude that achievement plays a huge role in having self esteem, because my true self-esteem is caused by my own achievements, and due to others personal experience true",3.5,3.5,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.6432950496673584,3.851468086242676,3.7316293716430664,3.6515841484069824,3.759204864501953,3.76251482963562

"i strongly believe that technology is positive on human life because of all the effects it had on us in the past and present. such as: technological advancements, you can talk to people easier, caused scientific break throughs which made us go further in life, and it also gave us security or protection. the technological advancements are practically everywhere because everything we use is technology. it has helped us with new vehicles that could possibly be more fuel efficient and possible will create more safety in the cars since it s easy to hurt someone in a crash. it helped us in school and made us understand things such as looking up answers you dont know or checking when the next test is. it inspires people to think of other ways we can advance our technology state currently. its really easy to talk to people because it doesnt take that much effort in order to have a conversation. the news is one example because it tells us whats happening even if they are far away from us, we can still hear them. the weather could change into a disaster and they would tell us to evacuate. it allows us to talk to relatives that live in other areas or countries. it could let us see political debates and see whats happening in other areas. without technology we wouldn t have had any scientific break throughs because it moslty helped us with everything in life. an example of this would be us landing on the moon which is a important day for the people because it showed that we could do really big things. if people did not take the time to study and think about the different scenarios then we would not have those outcomes. it helps us by looking up something we dont understand on the internet and in five seconds you could finally understand whatever you were trying to look up. one thing that makes us feel safe would be your own home but what if someone broke in and had bad intentions. there would be an alarm system that would ring and call the police to indicate that there was a intruder. it gives us security by giving us locks on important things such as banks so no one can enter it unless they knew your password or any other necessity. technology definitely played a huge role in our daily life and the evidence shows because everything we do involves technology or is something about technology. i strongly believe that technology doesn t stop human interaction but helps builds it up. i think this because we can text friends, text family, work on a project, or do school related stuff with it. if we keep on making up better technology or improve it then i believe it will make discover or invent big things that will push us into the future.",4.5,4.5,4.0,4.5,4.5,4.5,3.6165270805358887,3.6885716915130615,3.7827370166778564,3.604680061340332,3.6251637935638428,3.737663745880127
do curfews keep teenagers out of trouble? in this essay i will discuss as to why curfews could be a necessary law for teenagers. one of the reasons curfews could help out parents keep their children safe is that teenagers like to hangout with friends late at night and having a curfew for teenagers could prevent them from getting in some sort of trouble. another reason why curfews could keep teenagers more safe is teenagers think they know everything in this world but in reality they don t know how the world really is and anything can happen at any certain time. the finale reason why i think some teenagers need to have curfews is because some teenagers are still not mature enough to be out late at night and something could possibly happen to them. i think the reasons listed above is more than enough evidence to have curfews for teenagers to keep them safe and to keep parents aware and calm for their children. as a parent or guardian of a teenager we all want to keep our children as safe as possible because anything could happen outside our homes. in concussion i think the reasons listed above is more than enough evidence to have curfews for teenagers to keep them safe and to keep parents aware and calm for their children. as a parent or guardian of a teenager we all want to keep our children as safe as possible because anything could happen outside our homes. curfews can be good thing to keep parents aware of what their children are doing but i personally think they should not be a law for every teenager. for example some parents they are ok with letting their child to be out late at night but as long as they stay in contact with a parent at all times. that shows that not every teenager in this world is irresponsible and is aware for their own actions.,3.5,3.0,3.5,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.649684190750122,3.521620273590088,3.524994134902954,3.7215349674224854,3.623258352279663,3.571883201599121

"everyone has a talent or skill. for example, my talent is drawing. drawing is really useful because i can use it for a lot of things like school projects,plays,and more. to get good at something i enjoy doing it takes a lot of time and effort for me to be good at the activity i enjoy doing. every one has a talent or skill but the only way to develop that talent or skill is by hard work,practicing,and doing it constantly. firstly,everyone has a talent or skill but the only way to develop that skill is by working hard. for example,when i first started drawing. when i first started to draw i was really bad,cause i didnt practice at all. however,when i started to put that hard work in i started to get good at drawing and then i saw that i can only get better by working hard. moreover,working hard is a chance for me to show my self what im capable of doing. working hard is good for me because im challenging my self to do better in life as i get older and get better in my skills and talents. as can be seen,just by working hard can take someone far in life to achieve greatness. secondly,everyone has a talent or skill but the only way to develop that talent or skill is by practicing it. for example, my friends talent is playing soccer. my friend is really good at soccer because he practices and trains everyday. even though my friend is small and skinny he doesnt care who he plays against because he can play with people twice his size and double his weight and still play good. for example,one day i went to see my friend play in a tournament. the day of the tournament was beautiful because the sun was out,the sky was blue, and the temperature was perfect. after a few minutes of us waiting, the game finally started and we got to see my friend play. at the beginning of the match my friend was going through everyone because of how he was playing. my friend was running so fast that he looked like a cheetah running for the ball. after the match was over they ended up winning the whole tournament because they had the most points which made my friend really happy cause all that hard work had finally paid off. later we went to eat at a restaurant which smelled like flowers and the food tasted like if it was from heaven. as can be seen,practicing can take people to achieve greatness. lastly,everyone has a talent or skill but the only way to develop that talent or skill is by constantly doing it. for example,when my dad started to learn how to play the guitar. at first my dad was really bad because he had never played a guitar in his whole life,so he told his friend to teach him hot to play it. my dads friend told him everything he needed to know on how to play it,so my dad",3.5,4.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.846635103225708,3.989013910293579,4.032841205596924,4.10687255859375,3.834686040878296,3.930494546890259

"the school board plans to add one and a haft hours to each school day. do you think is a good ideas to extending the school day? the school board should not add one and a half hours to each school day because all the students will got stress,all the school program will get delay, and the all starts to skipping school. the first reason why the school board should not add one and a half hours to each school day is because all the students will got stress. some students can get depression by learning to much. they don t want to study anymore because of the long day in school. they will get very tired of sitting all day. they will not do their homework because they have to memorize a lot of thing at school are ready. they don t have a lot of time left at home to study or do in their homework. they will not interesting in school anymore. that s the first reason why the school board should not one and a half hours for each school day. the seconds reason why the school board should not extending the school day is because of the school program and activity will got delay. so if the school board add one and a half hours of school all the after school program will get delay. no more students want to stay after anymore because if to late. just think about the transportation from the school. if a student live in a rural area they have to wake up at a.m to get ready for school because from his/her house is one hours away for the school. if the student planning to stay after school she/he may not get home at p.m. and he/she have to get home before p.m to be available to do her/his homework. that is all the reasons why school should not extending the school day. the cost of electricity every year is over millions dollars, just think about how much it can cost the school board if they add one and a half hours of school each day? if the school board add one and a half hours for each school day, all the students can learn more thing. the last reasons why the school should not add one and a half hours because the cost of electricity. every years the school board have to pay over millions dollars. if the school board spend over millions to the electricity every years then how many millions for every thing else. the school board will not have a lot of money let to updates the school. the school board should not add one and a half hours to each school day because all the students will got stress, the school program and activity will got delay, and the cost of electricity. that is all the reason why the school board should not add one and a half hours for each school day. are you agree or disagree with extending the school day?",2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.0,2.5,3.0705783367156982,2.922431707382202,2.961426019668579,3.0294342041015625,2.823650598526001,2.962423086166382
"i agree with it because everyone has to do something productive in school and playing a sport is good for our health, yearbook writing is good for our spelling, and serving in a student council makes you be more confident and talk more with other people. playing a sport is the best way to make our bodies stronger and healthy, it also helps us mentally when you are going through times going outside and playing helps you a lot. playing a sport in school helps you have more energy and be ready to learn it likes opens your mind. soccer for example is helps your body be stronger, volleyball helps your hands be more stronger, basketball helps you jump higher, and football helps you run faster. writing or coloring the yearbook is a great idea too, because you are writing something that everyone is going to see so i know you gonna write neat and correctly. coloring is good for our brains too it helps us be calm and out of stress. spelling is one of the most important things and writing helps it improved it, coloring is something that not everyone knows how to do it, but by practicing we are gonna learn. serving in a student council helps you a lot because you learn something very important and thats learning how to communicate with other people and be nice. sometimes its hard to communicate or talk to other people but we have to do it because sometimes the people needs someone to talk to and someone to be there for them. helping to helping is a best thing you can do maybe you are not getting something from it but at least your being a helper. in conclusion i think that everyone has to do something is school it doesnt matter what but we have to. school is not just for learning and being bored in class, school is for you to be happy and confortle with everything, we can make school fun.",3.0,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.2202107906341553,3.1814942359924316,3.141939401626587,3.18683123588562,3.175915002822876,3.224318027496338
"have you ever just sat down and thought, do we really accomplish more if we are always doing something, or does inactivity also serve a purpose? some say sayings have a reason for example thomas jefferson wrote ""determine never to be idle... it is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing something"", does this mean it is true because he said it? or is it just something he wrote because it was his opinion? i strongly agree with what thomas jefferson wrote, it s saying in little words don t be lazy, it s amazing how much can get done if we are always doing something. if we are always doing something other than what we want to accomplish it takes time and the process just gets longer. i believe that inactivity serves a purpose even though your inactive or active some or many things can be accomplished. one reason i believe that inactivity serves a purpose is because, more can be accomplished when you are not active and working. i have experienced this numerous of times at my job. at my job, we have task we have to get done by a certain time which is closing and sometimes those task don t get done due to how busy the store gets, when the store gets busy we can t get what we want accomplished, but say we are not active, or working and the place gets slow and calm. we have the time to get our task done and meet the requirements and leaving on time. when you are super active and busy it get hectic and that just adds more to your tasks. for example your making some food, drinks and theres more and more orders, you can t make something then clean your gonna have to keep going and clean it all up at the end when it slows down. in my opinion you get what you want accomplished when your less active in this case. another reason i believe that inactivity serves a purpose is because, when your not active you don t know what your gonna accomplish that day, but out of boredom your gonna get something out of it. this happens to me all the time where one day i m just free all day with absolutely nothing to do, and i just lay in bed with a mess in my room not even thinking about the mess and all of a sudden i start cleaning everything and organizing everything. like thomas jefferson says ""determine never to be lazy... it is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing something"" in this case it works both ways because if your doing something you get something accomplished and something good out of it, but if your doing absolutely nothing then you get nothing accomplished. lastly i believe that inactivity serves a purpose because, say your going to try out for the boys or girls soccer team and there is only spot left. obviously your going to need to practice",3.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.0,4.0,3.3235762119293213,3.101849317550659,3.1654694080352783,3.3111836910247803,3.0786914825439453,3.155848979949951

"it s a good idea to have homework club at your school. every school should have homework club at least three times a week. homework club is a club where teachers help you with your homework or if you need help understanding a subject. homework club helps students get to learn a little bit more about that subject, be more active with theirs friends, and it makes them have more confidence about their work. homework club is a big help for students. there s so many stuff you can do at homework club and that is finishing a project with a friend, studying for a test/quiz, or even finishing your homework early. at homework club you get so much help from the teachers. you can finish a project with a friend and when you do that it helps you be more active with that person. if a student ever has a doubt with a question about their project, then they can go to homework club and get some help with their project. the best part about homework club is that when more students come, we get to help each other with our projects. it s like a community were we help each other with any questions we have. projects are really hard when you do it by yourself, but if you go to homework at your school then you will get all the help you need. if your having trouble then the best place to go is homework, so you can get some help. another thing you can get do at homework club is study for a test/quiz. the teachers will help you make flashcards, help you over the study guide, or even play a game of kahoot. if you didn t know what kahoot is, kahoot is a game where it helps you a lot before a test/quiz. i can say that kahoot is like a study guide but form into a game. many students can t really study for a test/quiz when they are at home, because they can t concentrate studying when they are alone. so if you go to homework club they will help you study for your test/quiz and you will for sure not get distracted. i recommend everyone to come to homework club at least three times a week so you can get help studying for a test/quiz or if you need help with something else. if you go to homework club then you will pass your test/quiz, cause homework clubs will help you prepare yourself for your test/quiz the last thing that homework clubs helps you is get your homework done early. the teachers will explain everything perfectly and i guarantee you will learn even more then what you learn in class. math teachers, science teachers, history teachers, and english teachers are going to teach students so much more. you can go to homework club and do your homework early so you don t have to worry about doing it at home. in homework club teachers explain the homework to the students but with more",3.5,3.5,4.0,3.0,3.5,4.0,3.812690019607544,3.7070791721343994,3.8484439849853516,3.9621288776397705,3.8115501403808594,3.8310048580169678
"in my opinion it is a good idea for students to commit to a career at a young age. if you re committed to anything you will always want to achieve that certain goal. having a career you are committed to at a young age has many positive outcomes. one of the outcomes is you can find a career much faster. another positive outcome is having a goal that you want to achieve. the final positive outcome is having more time in high school to do other activities. having a certain career you want to achieve at a young age will make you improve on lots of things. you will find a career much faster if you re committed to one specific career at a young age. if you are focused on that certain career you will be doing things that you need to achieve to have that certain career you have been planning at a young age. for example when you are committed to that one certain career you will be taking specific classes. finally when you sign up for that career or try out for that career you will most likely get accepted since you will have experience. having experience on a career will help you so much when applying for a career. people will most likely see that you have experience and want to hire you. that is why it is better having a career you are committed to at a young age. if you have a goal you want to achieve at a young age you will do anything to achieve that goal you since you re committed to achieve that goal. it is also just like being committed to a certain career at a young age. for example in order to achieve a goal you will need to do anything it takes to achieve it. as in a career you need to study as much as you can of the career and take classes that will help you achieve the career you are interested in. if you have a goal you will most likely achieve the goal if you try and never give up. if you give up on the goal you will not succeed. just like in a career you are committed to at a young age. if you give up on the career you will most likely need to find another career and learn new things and start all over. that is why you should have a career already planned at a young age so you won t give up later on and need to start all over. you will have more time in high school to do more activities if you are committed to a certain career at a young age. for example in high school their are many sports , clubs , and other after school activities you can do or tryout for. if you already have a certain career in mind since you were little and young you can have more time to do sports and other activities that can also help",3.5,3.0,4.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.841291666030884,3.988308906555176,4.135706901550293,4.102659225463867,4.034238815307617,3.9904420375823975
should school have to add one and half hours to each day? i disagree because student have to do stuff after school like some student have practice for sports and more. another reasons why i disagree is because student might not like school and it can get boring. something else why i disagree is because parents might want you after school for something and if you come from school late them can t do what your parents are telling u want to do. some reasons why i disagree is because you might have to do thing after school. something are you might have sports practice for a team or for clubs. another reason why is because some students have family things to do out of school and it would be for a long time. some student would have doctor appoints and that is very important. another reasons why i disagree is because student will get bored in school. some student can start to get mad try to leave the school and get in trouble and the student can get in a fight. something else is that student can fall asleep and not pay attention to the teachers and they can get trouble as well as the student can stay even longer. something is that they would not be able to learn if they fall asleep. last reasons why i disagree is because parents might need their child after school for something. there parents might need them to help clean them clean there house. if they need to tell them something important. another reason why is because there parents might need help to buy food for there house. some parents might not like that because they would not be able to see there child for a long time. that why i disagree because school is just for certain time it not all day. some student will get bored and not want to come school again. they might have thing to do after school like sports and practices or other thing. some student parent might need help from there child and would want to see them more time not for a little while. that why i disagree that we should not have add and half hours to each day.,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.5,2.715867757797241,2.653933525085449,2.6424827575683594,2.7528178691864014,2.6613237857818604,2.711103677749634
"self-esteem comes from achievement. my reason for saying this is because you shouldn t be getting praised for a low assignment that they did; then they are not going to grow. my other reason was that teachers are here to help students improve and if the student know they didn t the best they could ve and get praised for it; then they re going to think that they don t have to do that much and will have a low self-esteem. to elaborate more on my first reason for why i say self-esteem comes from achievement is because if you do excellent on a paper and are positively sure you did amazing then you should be getting praised. that shows how much a student can have a high self-esteem for themselves. even though, the paper probably wasn t easy that person didn t get lazy. they wanted to do better which means that they want to grow and improve not just stay where they are. i am going to explain my second reason for why self-esteem comes from achievement. this is all about the students and how they improve. therefore, if a student knows they could ve done better on an assignment and get praised for the lazy work that did then they are going out think that they don t need to do that much work anymore. although, as the teacher; they shouldn t be praising students on lazy work. they should pull them aside and say "" hey this was good but it wasn t you best work; i know you can do better"". my counterclaim is teachers shouldn t let students get away with lazy work. i say this because sometimes some students might think that the teachers don t pay attention to them or they don t care about their work. even though, if the student approaches the teacher with a problem then the teacher will remember you and know to check up on you when it comes to your work. in conclusion, true self-esteem does not come from praise on an effortless assignment. if you praise students on a low assignment then that s the level they are going to stay at because they got praised to be lazy. which means that the teacher leaves the student not wanting to improve and expand on their writing skills. sincerely, generic_name",3.5,3.5,4.5,4.0,4.5,4.0,3.7217624187469482,3.8794925212860107,3.783324718475342,3.957195281982422,3.804347276687622,3.7955026626586914

"i think an enjoyable educational activity for me is gym. because gym is the most fun class i have this year these are some examples of why i like gym. the first reason why i like gym is because during the warm up we are aloud to talk to our friends while we are walking. also another reason why is when we finish doing our warm up we get to play games or do fun activities. the last reason why is we could also go outside to do games or activities when it is nice outside. the first reason why i enjoy the beginning of gym is because you can walk around the gym and talk to your friends. . and not have to wait to talk till lunch to talk all you want. but the main reason why i like that part of gym is because i love to talk even though at sometimes i got nothing to talk about. another reason why is that i love hanging out with my friends or to hear about there problems. talking helps you feel much better and lonely so i think that talking is fun and important at the same time. then the other reason why i like gym is because we get to play fun games or activities sometimes. because i like getting distracted from stuff with something fun like a game or activities. the fun games could help someone feel relaxed and forget about something that might be worrying them. another reason why i like that is because l think it is much more fun than having to be in health, doing the pacer or doing push ups. but other people do enjoy those stuff but i highly dislike doing those things. but the games could help you get some exercise and keep you having fun the gym class instead of being bored and exercising the last and final reason why i like gym is because sometimes we go outside when the weather is nice to do activities or other stuff like that. i like going outside because i like it when it is nice and warm out to be doing exercise. it is also nice to be out there and be racing or playing soccer and maybe football. but it is also big outside to be holding all of the gym classes together and the teachers could teach together. and you could also do much more outside even though some people dont like going outside i think it is much better because their is much more space and more fresh air.",4.0,3.0,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.0,3.696889638900757,3.5401339530944824,3.523237705230713,3.716743230819702,3.5276918411254883,3.5153861045837402
"dear business manager. first of all this essay is written with the meaning of what kind of occupations i would like to do as student, which is good to know that there is someone that is interested on helping students like me, also as student i would like to start by the right way and taking what is the best for me for example what is going to be a job which will make me feel comfortable to know that my qualities and my knowledge will play an important roll depending of the job that i might get. to tell you more about what i like to do is simple and easy at the same time, it doesn t matter how hard something it gets for me because in the end i always end up pulling through, althought i like to think before make a choise because is always hard when i do stuffs at the very beginning with no concern or knowledge of what am i suppose to do. in this case, as a beginner i get excited no matter what the work it might be, i can tell that i m not afraid to begin with new chalenges. so one of the reasons you should invite me for job oportunities is because unlike the rest of my partners at school they don t have the spirit of a fighter like i do, because i always try to give it all i ve got because i know this is my heart and like my dad told me ones if ""if you don t fight for it don t expect for the things that you want to come for you"", and to prove myself that i can be someone on this world having a good job and be respected for it,so i can be able to support myself and my family as well, work hard in every little single thing i do is what i have to make sure that i can be capable and responsible of doing it. in the other hand let s say that at least for now i want to graduate from high school, then go to college to start a career of mechanic, because mechanic is the number one on my checklist in other words my favorite, however this is would it be a big opportunity if you actually choose me for the job opportunity, because as it is for me this is going to be a really good starting for me, after all i think i can show you what i mean by saying i don t give up because my father always told me when i was a little kid; no matter what happens after i had to give it all, never leave a little bit of what i could let on my effort, also because he is been a great example for me since i was a kid or since i remember my childhood. instead of being a bad boy, he showed me what do i have to to with my values and things",3.0,2.5,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.5,3.3449838161468506,3.24434232711792,3.27978515625,3.354738235473633,3.3198623657226562,3.2917258739471436
"have you ever been in class unsure about what your learning even though you have been paying attention? i m sure that would be majority of upper classmen students. i can admit i ve have been several of times, in my opinion distance learning is a wonderful idea. students can move at their own pase , you can replay the lesson video as much as needed , and it will prevent you from failing a class. school can be stressful expecially when you miss a day and you feel like your behind on everything. then when the teacher explains it to you , if you don t understand you might not want to ask for him/her to repeat it again. this can be avoided by the power of distance learning you ll be able to have classes online so you can move at your own paste. you wouldn t have to worry about asking a staff or classmate what you missed. also you can take notes and do your classwork whichever way it works best for you. however some students are visual and independent learners they focus better when they work by themselves. working in a group at times might not always be the best option. when reviewing for a test or quiz you can go back and reread ,study, and take notes on whatever you re struggling with. those notes can be reviewed as much as you want. if you re a type of person that has to have things repeated to you multiple times this is a great opportunity for you. last but not least , are you failing a class due to not having enough time to turn your work in? you would probably not have to worry about that anymore because you can do your work at anytime. in class you are given a time limit you have to turn in your assigment. when your doing it online yes im sure there is a due date but you re not told what time your suppose to start at. if your at sports practice or have any free time you can start working on it. in my opinion this will prevent you from failing a class because you can turn it in whenever your ready to. to sum it up this is an amazing opportunity alot of students should be looking to attend. if your school is offering this to you i highly recommend it. it can keep you on track and motivate you to complete and turn your work in on time so you don t fall behind in class. you can move at your own paste without anyone rushing you. and lastly, you can replay and reread anything as you would like with no limits. this is a big help for students who want to reach their goal of earning a diploma.",4.5,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.5,3.0,3.8634464740753174,4.099187850952148,3.9529197216033936,4.096617221832275,4.009321212768555,3.983125925064087
"in this world many of us make decisions by ourselves and others seek guidance to make decisions in their life. while some people argue that people should seek guidance to make decisions in their life, but i think it is more beneficial if people make their own decisions because if people make their own decisions they will develop their self confidence and they will become responsible person. also, if people make their own decisions they will have happier life in the the future. it s true that by making our own decisions that we will develop our self confidence and become responsible person. if person make decision that decision might be hard, after making the decision the person will develop his or hers self confidence and they will become responsible for the decision that they made. for example, if one person decides to leave his parents house to live by his own, he will be responsible for himself because he decided not to live with his parents no more. this will help him to be responsible person because he has to take care of himself by his own. another example can be, in school, students choose their classes for next year by themselves. this will help them to develop their self confidence because they are deciding what is better for them or not by their own. also, this will help them to decide and have a confidence in what they will major in the future. so, by making our own decisions we can develop our self confidence and become responsible person. secondly, it s also true that by making our own decisions we will be happy and have happier life. when people make important decisions by themselves and if they achieve their goal by making this decision they will become happy and they can have happier life. for instance, if one student decided not to go college, instead he wanted to become a soccer player. if the student worked hard and become a professional soccer player he will be happy and will have happier life because he decided to become a professional soccer player by himself instead of going college. additionally, in school, when i was sophomore, i was choosing classes for next year and i decided to take classes that i thought that are important for me and that can help me for college. then when i take the classes this year i was very happy of my decision because this classes helped me a lot. so, people should make their own decision because they will be happy and have happier life by the decision they made. on the other hand, some people argue that people should seek guidance to make decisions in their life because it helps them not to make wrong decisions, but i think that is wrong because if you always seek guidance to make decision in your life the decision that you made may not satisfy you in your future life. for example, if your parents advice you to make decision to become a doctor and if",4.5,4.5,4.5,4.0,3.5,4.0,3.703155040740967,3.715609073638916,3.6989669799804688,3.8015429973602295,3.6925058364868164,3.743964910507202
"one topic that is that is frequently debate today is four-day school week. some people think is better for students, so they can have three days free to do their homework and have a par time job. i believe that students don t need four-day school and extend the school day two hours, because some students can t work after school or do our homework, students can t have time for our families in afternoon. and students can t have three days off and after come and they will not remember what they learn last class. one reason why is students can t work after school or do their homework because students will come tire after ten hours on school. student will come late and they will come just to have a dinner and sleep. students will come so late that they will not be able to do their homework on time do to no time for them. students need five day to do what they normally do they will have time for homework, have a dinner, and sleep well everyday. and the next they they can come ready to learn more and enjoy the school hours. another reason why is that students will not have time for their families. students having ten hours in the school come tires and they don t want to talk not event with their families. some students come straight to the bed and their families don t have time to talk to them or give an advice. some families have the tradition to go out like five or six at clock but students will not be able to go out with families and friends. that s why students need the normal days to study they have a routine that they follow. the final reason why is that students can t take three days off and after come they will not remember what they learn last class. some teachers choose that monday is a really good day to start with a test or quiz students will not remember what they learn after three days with out study. sometimes students are learning a topic really important and they understand but when they come after three days off they will not remember anything. if students will have three days off they will work these days and when they come back to school after three days of they will not be able to remember everything they will forget. students need the five days to study how suppose to be. as you have read four-day school is not good idea because students will not have time to study do their homework and enjoy with their families. if students have four days school, ten hours at day students will be tire and they will not here the same routine that they use to have. only when students have the normal school days they will have time to learn more and focus more. and have the best time as possible with family.",3.5,2.5,3.0,3.0,2.5,2.5,3.15623140335083,2.8526721000671387,2.856472969055176,3.146439790725708,2.8420917987823486,2.9874794483184814
"have you ever though of people who use technology has limit their communication to others? nowadays people who use technology are consistent spending their time on electronic device. technology has a negative impact on human lives due to their daily routine. the first reason is people s communication skills will decrease over time. spending a lot of time on technology without comminicating with others, will affect your communication skills. therefore, talking to someone who you haven t talked with for a while can be awkward. this shows that understanding between two people might have consequence and will be not accurate than it should be. the second reason, people who use electronic device are unlikely aware of the surroundings. for example, people who are walking in street using headset or earbuds on that cover their ears is a bad choice. this shows a sign of danger, because you won t be hearing anything. people who are aware of surrounding are more safe to cross a street and communicate with people who are passing by. this shows a negative effect of people who block their earing has higher chance to get into a accident. some people say that technology helps them communicate by commenting on a website which is true, but that is not important because the person will be not always active and able to comment back on time, whenever they are on. if you are communicate in person you can read the person s mood. you can get a faster respond than waiting for the person to comment back. in this way is more accurate and able to trust each other more by communicating in person that you have meet or have not meet before. the final reason is library is more accurate than reading books online. for example like reading online recommendation is not always accurate because of the people s preferance. you can ask the librarian for recommendation and librarian also assist you whenever you need help. you can read on your device but it is limited because of the battery. unlike books, have no battery which means it doesn t have any limit. this shows reading on books is a better than reading on a device. in conclusion technology had a negative effect on people lives. people should be aware that around them and spend their time in their technology on a necessary way. there should be a limit of how much time you are using on technology. is better to communicate in person and don t wear anything that cover your ears while talking to someone. this affect our daily lives, so limit the time you use in technology.",3.5,3.5,4.5,3.0,3.5,4.0,3.5504627227783203,3.4477317333221436,3.562246084213257,3.467270851135254,3.4669559001922607,3.536954164505005

"being ourselves in a world strongly influenced,manipulated,and corrupted by people. make a big difference in our lives .this also make us to know, who we are. because we should not change our personality,our cultures,and how we were educated. although being like other people make us to socialize easily. nevertheless, we should not change our personalities. because our personality is what help us to become our dreams in reality. for example there is a case of two guys who were twins one of them was nice all the time, and the other rude because he was influenced by his friends all the time having even a weird personality, that nobody liked. they attended to the same school their last year in high school, the one who was rude had many problems and one of those problems took him to death, however, his brother who was upset by his death, never stopped being a nice guy and having a great personality,he graduated from high school and attended to one of the best universities in the united states. additonally having a real personality without any change help us to be more honest with ourselves. i remember last year in my math class my teacher told us to check our assigment by ourselves. in the honor system and i only got six of the ten questions right which was a sixty percent i told her the true and after she checked she gave points extra, she said that i deserved for being honest. in fact our personality gaves us an attitude and help us to be honest with ourselves. another important reasons for which we should keep being ourselves is because we should not lose our culture. because our culture makes us special and different to the rest. for example there is a story of a girl who moved from colombia to canada where she always practiced her culture even made a club with her traditions that colombian people in canada visited,so she became famous really fast and made a lot of money. additionally it is important to keep our culture in anywhere because the culture is an important legacy that children adapt from their parents. one amazing example of this is leonel messy a great soccer player, from argentina, who has been living in spain for a long time. however he is still practicing his culture and does not change his accent thanks to his family which made him to beloved by all latin america. therefore keeping practice our cultures will make our families, and others to be proud of us also it is important to be ourselves, to show how we were educated. due to our education is what define by itself how we threat other people. for example on the newspaper was written a story of a guy who teached a long time ago english to his students in a particular way giving them candies when they participated,he never changed his method and all his students got good scores always. actually our education is most the most need in our life. for example",4.5,3.0,4.5,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.4232795238494873,3.1818292140960693,3.203920841217041,3.3441920280456543,3.173243284225464,3.260390520095825

"should school extend two more hours to the normal schedule? one topic that is frequently debated is whether school should extend the day schedule or keep a normal schedule as they have it already. some people think that school should not expend two more hours to our normal schedule. they feel that if we spend two more hours at school, it will be boring and tired. in my opinion, school should extend two more hours to our schedule for many reasons: i can spend more time to learn in classes, spend more time with friends, and work one more day during the week. once, i was pretty nervous about my earth science sol test, i did not know what to do to pass it because i never passed any quiz or test that we did during the school year, and i felt worried because i did not understand some topics, and i only had one week to learn everything, so i decided to stay everyday after school to practice with my teacher and by myself at home, after a couple days of practicing i realized that i had learned what i needed to learn and i felt ready to take my sol and finally, i passed it. now i know that spending more time in classes helps us to understand what we do not understand yet, learn more about the topics that we are practicing in class, and get ready for any test that we have during the semester. sadly, i am a senior, and this is my last year in high school, and that means that maybe, i will not see some friends and teachers again, so i am trying to enjoy everyday in the school expending time with friends and teachers whether during lunch or during classes, and i think that spending at least more minutes with them in every class will help us to know more about each other, and to make more experiences to remember after we graduate from high school. as some students, i do not have a permanent job or an everyday job as some people call it, i work for a moving and storage company, and that means that i can only work saturdays and sometimes sundays because i come to school and they ask me to be ready in the company at : am when i am going to work, but having a free day school during the week would benefit me because i would be able to work one more day during the week, and earn extra money to buy something that i might need. as you have read, i am agree about extend the school day two more hours. only when we realize that spending more time at school would helps us to learn easier, make a lot of experiences with friends and teachers, and gives us a free day school to work, to do homework, to spend time with family, or do some chores at home, the world will be a better place with students that understand what they need to",4.0,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.878876209259033,3.951700448989868,3.9508938789367676,4.123924255371094,3.960871934890747,3.8856008052825928

"dear schoolboard, i think that school should not be extended. students need to have a long break at home because they might have after school clubs to attend to. i think students should not have extended school because they are not going to pay attention to the teacher they need to rest their brains for a long time since you are in school for hours. another reason why i think students should not have extra time at school is because kids have to wake up early and they are tired so they wont pay attention since they dont get enough sleep. the other reason why i think school should not be extended is because the students most of them do not pay attention so typically the teacher is wasting her time trying to teach them. also why i think they should not extend school is because if the day is longer they are going to need more breaks during the day and it takes a little long to go back in the building. on the other hand i think they should have a extended school because they will know their subjects faster and that will make the school year faster. another reason why i think they should extend school is because the students are really bored at home and they wish to learn instead of being home board. the last reason why i think school should be extended is because kids might not pay attention during the day so with the extra hour they might want to pay attention and they will learn a little. the last reason why i think school should be extended is because the students do things outside of home that are not good for them like doing challenges,steeling or getting into fights outside of school which can cause them injuries. the other reason i think they should extend school is because students would or will have a better education so that when they are grownups they will find a job that pays you more than the others. these are the reasons why i think students should and should not have school extended i think they should extend school for a better education and i think they should not extend school because it is way too long",4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.5,3.0,3.746026039123535,3.7079923152923584,3.7571539878845215,3.91325044631958,3.6625044345855713,3.752025842666626

"""all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity.""why? well because it helps you a lot in the future or now so the principal is right on letting every student do an extracurricular activity. to me each student actually should participate in one or more activity. because it helps you mentally and emotionally,and helps you get collage credits and be healthy. many research has proven many reason why people should do at least one activity to help you benefit in life .research has proven people who have done sports most likely wont have heart attacks or won t even have breathing problems or mostly any issues. how it helps you benefit in staying fit or healthy or both is well playing a sport can really help you lose weight .help you be more active like for example playing baseball,basketball,track or even being a cheerleader and many other sports can help you a lot more then you think, because research has proven a lot that people who are more active are people who are benefiting from it a lot . another way it helps you is emotionally is because you get distracted and you dont think about the stuff that is stressing you all the time. you know you have a break from what is keeping you stressed because you are having fun. for example of having a way to distract yourself isn t just sports its working with other like helping out the councilor, helping out in making the yearbook, helping around in the school and not being just about you when your just thinking all about you well that is the problem. instead of have all the students separated you can put all of the students each in different groups everyday that way people get to know each other and have fun . collage credits also matter and playing a sport or just helping around the school would look amazing on a collage application . extra activities would make a lot more collages be interested in you and most likely be interested in giving you a scholarship. you mostly get into a great collage because all the extra credit actually helps you get noticed by a lot of collages because they aren t just looking for people who have good grades they are looking for people who actually are more outstanding. like grades are great, but how can you handle being nice . have certain thing taken care of before anything . well how you take certain things serious because if you can t take your own high school classes seriously how are you going to take care of your classes in collage .also collages are seeing how independent you are, and how well you do around others . having all the students do one or more extracurricular activity will benefit them so much of a lot of reasons why actually so you should try it out .also because it doesn t hurt you to give it a try . i agree fully with the principal because not everything is",3.5,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.6659135818481445,3.4296557903289795,3.5295658111572266,3.647549867630005,3.563687562942505,3.502357244491577
"i agree with this prompt that positive attitude is the key to success because, with positive attitude it gets a person where they want to be in life. however with negative attitude you will never get anywhere at all, it will make a person lose confident, also would make you give up right there on the spot which means you gave up your a quitter. then soon turn into a really bad habit that can t be stopped. attitude is very important, and the way you use it can really affect the success that your trying to reach and to others ,its also very easy to just lose it all in less than a heart beat. i believe positive attuide is the key to success because it motivates a person to do good or better, spreads positvity to others who really need it,and makes you learn from your mistake because no one is perfect. how can positive attitude motivate you to do good? well ya see when your having that energy that makes you believe you can do anything, or that anything is possible that s motivation for you to keep trying and embracing that positively well make a person stand out. by doing that it makes a person feel good about themselfs and motivates us to keeping that same energy. this is why it s important just by your attitude can have a huge impact on your success and how you use it is very important. by motivating your self, and others themselves will be motivated which is a really good thing. it s like your helping others out one of the first things to do to become successful , to help each other out and having a lot of patients is all in that positive attuide. this plays many key roles in the real world and will make a huge difference as well. an example, walking in for an interview being positive at all costs and respectful shows signs that your interested therefore you would have a possibility of getting hired and can go from there you will be a very successful person. i know everyone is successful in there own ways but there are limits and attitude plays a huge role in that. spreading positively to others is another important topic because these people might not be doing so well but you can always help change that for a person. by boosting their confident to make them happy comes from positive attuide because in life, theres no time to be playing games there s very little time to accomplish your success before it s over and soon to be regretted. also in encouraging others will make you extremely happy that right there will get you somewhere in the future and it will be good. most jobs in this life style today sometimes go based of skills and etc. but mostly look into a great positive attitude, there are a lot of benefits to this in reality being skillful and useful. when something doesn t go as planned, keep trying",3.0,3.0,4.0,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.717402458190918,3.7258927822113037,3.7488043308258057,3.7165050506591797,3.6375198364257812,3.6818652153015137

"to begin with, it is good idea for students to finish high school in three years and enter college or the work force one year early?. in point of view, it is good idea because when students finish their high school in three years, they also can work, and save money to enter college. so it s good for students graduate in three years and obtain their diploma, and start to apply in some college. also, students can find better jobs with their diploma. first, it is good idea for students graduate and obtain their diploma because some students need the diploma to enter college. for example, my friend generic_name needed her diploma and start to apply in summer to enter at the hampton university. furthermore, students who s want to achieve their diploma in three yaers, they have to work hard. but some students wants to achieve their goals without make any kind of effort. second, students can find better jobs with their diploma because if you don t have any diploma you cannot work in a proffessional job where people pay more. for example, my sister generic_name have to work after she graduate from from high school, but she need a good job to save money to enter one year later at college and pay her first semester. instead, some students have to work because they don t have any type of help from their families. if students have to work is because they want to enter college. third, some students cannot finish their high becuase they have to work for maintain themself. for example, my cousin generic_name cannot finish his studies because he have to work at : pm to : pm so he don t have time to his asignments of high school. some students can t graduate not because they don t want to, cause they have to pay bills from their homes. also, they don t have a better job to pay their studies from college and its harder to them to obtain the diploma from high school. in conclusion, it is good idea for students finish their high school in three years and enter to college. so it s good for students graduate in three years and obtain their diploma. so students can find better jobs with their diploma and pay their studies from college. but, students can t graduate not because they don t want to, cause they have to work and pay bills from their homes. also, when students have a positive main they can achieve whethever they want, it doesn t matter the situation that you live you can finish your high school and enter college if you work hard.",3.0,3.0,3.0,2.5,2.5,3.0,3.2554683685302734,3.181169271469116,3.1548912525177,3.285865068435669,3.178070545196533,3.206556558609009
"throughout the course of our history,education has always been placed amongst the most important necessities,as it not only helps us learn and better ourselves,but because it also opens new doors and possibilities for us. in the past,schools couldn t offer differing alternatives,because technology wasn t as present as it is today. schools can now offer education to students,all while being at different locations. by students taking classes at home,they ll be able to benefit because they won t feel as socially distressed as they would in person,the level of education could be better and possibly help them graduate earlier,and they wont t have to endure social issues, such as bullying. many people tend to believe that because they go to school,they won t have a hard time adjusting and fitting in with the masses,but to contrary beliefs,there s a lot of people who do struggle with social anxiety and overall,tend to have a hard time fitting in. firstly,an example of this, is my cousin generic_name. he does have friends,but he feels extremely overwhelmed by being around so many different people,mostly because he s always struggled with social anxiety. generic_name decided that he would still like to pursue and attain his education,so he started looking for different alternatives that could help him do so. after much research and gathering of information,he concluded that distance learning was the best choice for him,as he wouldn t have to endure overwhelming amounts of people,or feel pressured by the constant necessity of having to wake up early during the mornings. another example would be my friend generic_name,who never really had problems of fitting in and making friends,but overall disliked the whole ordeal of the school system itself. she then decided to pursue her education through another medium,that medium being,distance learning. secondly,what a majority of people don t tend to realize,is the fact that you could achieve a better education,and even graduate at an earlier rate. this is another benefit of distance learning. many people tend to believe that attending school,actually decreases their chances of being able to graduate early and of becoming more independent from their families at a younger age. many individuals throughout the course of the world,utilize distance learning because they would like to achieve their educations at a faster pace,than those who are enrolled in schools. a prime example of this,is my friend generic_name. he was an excellent student while at school,but he wanted to find a way of being able to take advanced courses,that not only prepared him for college and provided him with advanced credits,but also helped him graduate at an earlier age. generic_name is now a professional,with a degree in marine biology. he achieved these accomplishments,all at the young age of . another example would be my other friend,generic_name. she had always excelled at school,but she wanted an alternative that provided her with a better education and a chance of being able to enroll into college at a younger age. after much thought and consideration,and much conversation with her family and peers,she ultimately decided that distance learning was the best choice.",3.0,4.0,3.5,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.8545992374420166,4.434457778930664,4.458498477935791,4.094371318817139,4.517326354980469,4.525883197784424

"it is true that keeping teenagers out of trouble is important for many reasons. if regulations that require teenagers to be off the streets after pm are adopted then they will help teenagers academically, socially, medically and economically. the first reasons that proves that these curfews will help teenagers and keep them out of trouble is that if teenagers are not allowed to be on the streets in the middle of the night , then they will get more sleep and will learn more efficiently when they are school. for example, if a teenager is not allowed to be on the street during the middle of the night, then that individual will get a good night of sleep and will be able to stay awake during classes. also, if this regulations are are adopted, then they will require teenagers to stay at home longer, which will help them because they will have more time to work on their homework and if they do their homework then they will improve their grades. furthermore, these curfews will help teenagers improve their learning skills and will also help them rest more and get their grades up. the second reason that shows why these curfews must be adopted is the one that will allow teenagers to socialize better. for example, if teenagers are in the streets in the middle of the night, then people will not want to be close to them because they might think that they are bad people and that they are probably involved in gangs, so they will be scared of them. many people will agree that it is better if teenagers stay at their houses during night hours because if they stay at their homes doing good things, then they will make more friend, socialize and communicate better with people because no one will be afraid of them and no one will think that they are involved in some criminal group. so, if teenagers keep themselves out of the street during the night, then they will be able to make friends, communicate better and basically socialize in a better way in which no one will try to avoid them. the third reason that proves that these curfews must be adopted is the medical reason. if teenagers are in the streets during the night, then they have the possibility of getting in fight and ending up with injuries. for example if a teenager is out during late night hours, then others might think that he or she is there because he s a bad person and then they might get into a fight in which someone could get hurt and end up in the hospital. these curfews will prevent teenagers from getting into fights and from having to go to the hospital when they can just stay at home and be safe. the last reason that will keep teenagers out of trouble and will help them is the economic reason. for example, if a teenager wants to be out in the middle of the night, then that individual can find himself or",3.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.6931264400482178,3.569979190826416,3.5740303993225098,3.704210042953491,3.607443332672119,3.5998239517211914
"sometimes when you are not doing anything or just do not do something physical, some good or great things could happen surrounding you and the world. my first idea that makes inactivity a ""self work"" in progress. meaing letting people around help you instead of you doing everything yourself. a movie called ""christopher robin"" shows that as a child, christopher did things before but he had imaginary animals helping him. the purpose of the movie, is to give the auidience the understanding of what it means to be always doing something, always occupy yourself with the simplest things that you do not really have to do. and adding pressure on yourself. than letting others help you, can create good things surrounding you and you can have good thoughts. because when you are stressed you are worried about how things will be in the future. having people help you can still have great success that can be accomplished. the example or message in this movie shows when christopher is an adult and he pre-occupys himself a lot, the more problems is caused with his life. he almost lost his wife and daughter because he was always occupied doing his business job. later when he realizes he was on the wrong track, his friend, pooh was telling him he is not the same as himself before. he told himself the only way he ll be less stressed and worried is to become the child inside him and bloom once more. letting your inside child out, he needs to find himself doing absolutely nothing, no stress, and just spend time with the life he has been given and his family. after doing that, he was more gifted than before, like this idea he had for how to make his business better but had never presented because he was always doing something like the thesis was talking about not doing something physical could lead to some good or great things, christopher found himself at the end. he is happy and relaxed with what he accomplished when he let go and did nothing. now he realizes the result of doing nothing and how different it would have been if he kept on occupying himself in things he should not be worried about rather than enjoying what he has to thank for. so the key is that if christopher robin can accomplish great or good things by doing nothing rather than doing something, then that means everybody else can learn as well the understanding to find success and move ahead.",3.0,3.0,3.0,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.880937337875366,3.9138128757476807,3.888829469680786,4.0596160888671875,3.921295404434204,3.9819107055664062
"i agree with ralph waldo s quote "" to be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you somthing else is the greatest accmplishment. in todays society everyone wants to be part of the wave to whatever is popular. people always go the extra mile to impress other people even if they have to change their style or the way they act. it s hard to be yourself in todays society so those who can do it have accmplished something great. being yourself is better because then you ll find your real friends. students in middle school and high school for whatever reason want to be cool. they think doing drugs, breaking rules and being disrespectful to others is cool. when they get home they re a different person. they re respectful, follow all the rules and don t do drugs because thats the way they are raised, they re being themselves. that shows the impact of what people consider being cool is. some students are at the wrong spot at the wrong time and start hanging out with the wrong group of people to be cool. this is important because they could be offered drugs or be offered to skip class. the students would say yes because they want to be cool knowing very well never to do it. this shows what could happen to a student who are trying to be cool. when they know to stay in school and never do drugs because that won t help your education it would only slow it down. for example one of my friends was skipping school and doing lots of things he wasn t supposed to be doing. he thought he was cool and told everyone. i guess you could say he got cool from it but in the long run he suffered. this is important because while him trying to be cool he ended up getting bad grades and getting kicked out of school. the school gave him one more chance and made him go to the carrer center where students who fail usually go. this shows what could happen when you try to be cool. being yourself is the best thing you can accomplish because you wouldn t worry about most things other students wear or say. you would go further in life being yourself and becoming something you want to become. if your don t want to become a doctor and want to be a car machanic then that what you do. being yourself would make you more happy then trying to fit in.",3.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.7609078884124756,3.7582321166992188,3.680690288543701,3.743781328201294,3.559272289276123,3.732553720474243

"it s has been saying people learn from their mistakes in order to accomplish a goal. keep those mistakes out make them less likely to build self-esteem. true self-esteem come from achievement because is better point the mistakes in order to success. point the errors keep student away to avoid do it next time, for example if a junior student is about to take the sat exam ; he decide to practice math problems .his math teacher decide to check his work, and he think praise his work is good because make him feel less worried about the exam, but the truth is making feel better is not helpful because he is not gonna get enough knowledge about his problems. i could say he is going to feel much better with a high score in his exam. lower the possibility to gain knowledge because the student in some point would have to use their knowledge it could be in college, at their job, and home. like in my sophomore year i had a english teacher who praise most of my work because she thought that would in increase my knowledge, but was the opposite i felt like i was going backward instead of forward. i found praising a student work make them learn less in the way if they have something wrong students would have to look for answer, so that mean if they find what they did wrong is a chance of increase their knowledge because they might find more than just the answer that they are looking for. student learn for their mistakes it s much better point those mistakes out than hide it form them. eventually student that don t show improvement are the ones that the teacher decide hide their errors because it s better clear the doubt. like a kindergarten student they asked a lot of question to the teacher, and most of the time the teacher correct their work to let them know what did they do wrong to improve their work. it would not make sense that the teacher tell to the all student that they know all the alphabet just to make them feel better, so the students could stop learning and focus in other activities like math, social studies, or even play. praising is not good as we thought because can make us be okay with our work, and not encourage us to learn. while some may say praise student work could keep the working to make them improve and build self-esteem, actually student learn form their mistakes, and it s better point it out than hide it from them because an error doesn t mean failure meant the student is improving to success. with the success comes the self-esteem.",2.5,2.5,2.5,3.0,2.5,3.5,2.9773049354553223,2.865274429321289,2.7718029022216797,2.9120919704437256,2.7457854747772217,2.899506092071533

"alot of people use cell phones in classrooms which i think it s a good idea. cellphones are use for emergencies and educational purposes. in my opinion students sometimes are given alot of work, where they have to find information on their textbooks, or dictionary that takes almost half of the class. when they can just look it up on their phone and take about to minutes. another thing is to think about are that students sometimes forget their homeworks at home and is worth half of your grade. and by having their phones with them, they can called their parents and asked them to drop up their homework at school. cellphones should be allowed in classrooms, students would be less stressed about school. they won t have to worry about carrying a heavy textbook, when they can just do their work on their cellphones. which it means, more work done and less time wasted on going page to page looking for the right answers. now let s talk about having a cell phone in classrooms in case of an emergnecy. one reason i believed they should allowed cellphones in classrooms because in case of a lockdown. if a student sees the person, but the police does not know how he looks like or has no idea where his at. the student can call and give details of the suspect. in addition to my other reason, students should be allowed to have their cellphone in case of an emergency call. what if something happens at home. for example, a students sibbling gets sick and doesn t stop crying until he sees one of his family. so the babysitter calls his parents, but his parents can t do anything because they can t leave work or they ll get fired. the parents would have to call the student, now the student have to leave school and take care of his sibbling. in conclusion, i see no reason why students shouldn t be allowed to use cellphones in classrooms. schools would be more easier and safetier. you may never know what could happen and a cellphone can be a huge impact. it can save someone s life. so i think student s should be allowed to have cellphones in classrooms. sometimes students read a whole book and they dont understand it so they stop doing their work. while you can use your phone and find all the things and learn instead of reading a whole book and find most of the things you were looking for but not learning at all.",4.0,4.0,3.5,4.0,3.5,3.0,3.900859832763672,3.914630174636841,3.871613025665283,4.069431781768799,3.8412575721740723,3.8669443130493164

in my personal opinion when some schools offer distance learning as an option for student to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing i mostly disagree. its not because i am attending a public high school. there are reasons why i mostly disagree about this situation. one of the reasons why i disagree is because this might hurt the students communication skills. when you have classes online you are not at the school you are home taking this class so you basically don t associate with anyone except your teacher now since i have never took a online class i wouldn t be able to tell if its better to not know no one or to associate with anyone but personally i just dont t thing it s good for students to attend online school if you are someone that like to work with people and not just your teacher. other students also might be able to understand some stuff that you don t understand and that they should be able to help you. they won t be able to help you if you not there with them. the second reason why i disagree and i really don t think that online schools is not beneficial is that it hurts your participation skills too. here in school we do so much activities connected to things we are learning and it helps very much because if you do activities connected to the things we are learning it gets stuck in your mind. its also better to ask questions and to understand better. there might be some stuff that you didn t understand face to face with your teacher its better to ask them like that and understand like that instead of emailing them or contacting them through different thing. also the teacher might not respond as soon as possible and that might be a problem and affect your grade and thats why its better to talk to your teacher face to face and deal with understanding face to face that s my second opinion. my last and final reason is that you might get lazy and miss classes since you take it at your home . that might affect your grade too which is very risky if you re not a productive and committed person to your education online class is not for you. for example me personally it will not be good for me because i am a very lazy person i am pretty sure i will miss classes either by sleeping in or some other unexeptalbe reasons . but also there are people that are very organized and careful people out here that can risk this for those kind of people online classes are good and they can take it because thy are committed to finnish there education in a very careful way. those are my good reason why i don t agree with online classes it s a good thing that schools offer distance learning as an option for students if you have a good reason,4.0,3.0,3.5,4.0,3.5,3.0,3.517228603363037,3.337911605834961,3.364286184310913,3.507286310195923,3.312607765197754,3.2789907455444336
"the majority of the students take about four years to graduate and go to the college, but also there are students who decide to finish the high school in tree years or as soon as possible. the question is, why are they trying to finish the high school earlier that the other ones?. a few people decide to finish the high school because they have other kind of goals to accomplish like travel or enlist to the army etc. in some situations this people aren t able to take electives courses like, graphic design, culinary arts, earth space, mathematics, health ap or driving class. whatever of this ones or others ones they can t enjoy them. in other situations this students take nigh school or summers school or both. in my personal opinion take nigh school is really tired because when you leave the school yo have about one hour to get ready and go to the other school to take your course. in other way, there are students who do not have support by their parents to finish the high school, and that is why they decide to finish early to have more time and find a job to support themselves. even if they have a half time job, is not enough. enlist to the army is a good idea for some people especially for high school students, they have a conversation with their parents to have the aprovation to do three years in the high school and get a career into the army. some guys also want to finish early because they want to go to the college in other country or because they want to travel and have a extravagant life, this are the most common situations of why students decide to graduate during three years, but is better that dropped the school in the last year if they have the normal school ( four years). i think that this programs that the district offer is good for those who have the potential to do it and finish the high school as soon as possible, and they need to know the probability to do not have or be able to have elective courses or generic_school. i know about some guy who decided to take this program offered by the schools districts. he told me that is hard because while he was in the school he also studied for the exams of nigh school and he had courses really bored and after that, he took summers school all of this on his freshman year, i think that the only need to be constant interest and keep a good grade to success. in my opinion take the traditional four year is better because you can enjoy of many things like the clubs in the school, community service or even participate in a sport team in the school like soccer, football, tennis or basketball. this things is what make a school awesome. in the traditional four year, you can pick electives courses that you really like it and do not make you",2.5,3.0,2.5,2.0,2.0,2.0,3.5498673915863037,3.3267757892608643,3.4677553176879883,3.525989532470703,3.33195424079895,3.3263256549835205
"have you ever do something bad in your life , and your friends influence you to do it ? well everybody has two types of friend one with good behavior and the other with bad behavior. but the teenagers of this time never think in consequences when they are following bad examples. so i believe that a good example by your own behavior is the best way to infuence other people because people learn things by examples, or if you get together with somebody who is not a good influence for you believe or not your are going to learn what he does. people is always around you they are always looking what you do and they are criticizing your actions. my first reason is because good behavior is the best way to influence people because if you are a smart person, educated , and happy your are going to be a example for other people and they might said that they want to be like you. many teenagers has ruin their life for following bad influences. people can said that we are old enough to know what is good or wrong but we never think from what is coming. the world is full of bad person and some people would ask their self, why there s too many bad people in this world? the answer is because people is influencing others to do bad stuffs. if human wants a better world for their kids they have to be good influences, good examples to the new generation that is coming. in my own experience i have seen friends and relatives that has ruin their life for getting together with people that is a bad influence for them. is really sad when you see somebody that is in jail or dead for following bad examples by having bad friends. when you are following a bad example that person never is going to tell you what are the consequences. as you can see babies when they are in the age of learning new things they do what their parents do or what they teach them to do. adults and teenagers are a little bit different because not all the time we do what people tell us to do, but we always end up learning something of that person. people is always criticizing so if you don t want to that happen be a good example. being a good influence people would trust in you, but being the opposite of that nobody would trust in you. and when we realize is too late because the people you appreciate are separating from you for been a bad influence for others or maybe for them. my grandma always said , "" what you crop, you would sow."" for me those phrases mean a lot because being a good example or having a good behavior will take you to succeed in life , and is not just that there are many ways to succeed in life too. for these reasons i believe that a good example is the",3.0,3.0,3.0,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.198082208633423,3.0525331497192383,3.119779586791992,3.183631420135498,3.095914602279663,3.011139392852783

"i agree with winston churchill that success consits and failing many times. one reason is that if you fail, that is going to make stronger for the next time. it s like a game; you are going to do whaterver it takes to gain the game. if you do not do it in the first round, it s going to be the second and you ll do even better. a lots of people think that if they don t do it in the first time, that s going to be it. they don t realize that if they just keep going they re going to get there, and be success. wouldn t it be great if we didn t have to fail? but that s how it s some times. we have to accept it and keep trying. life is fool of problems, but we just have hang in there and keep trying and get where we want. another reason is that never loss of enthusiasm, that s the most important reason of all of this. if we don t have that exclusive word is like life does not make sense at all. for example, i used to have this friend that his mom wanted him to be a doctor, but he didn t want to be a doctor. he wanted to be a teacher. farthermore, he study to be a doctor. he wasn t that good but that was what his mom wanted. the second year, which was even harder he just stop. he talked to his mom saying that was not for him. he did not have any enthusiasm on that career, so he fanilly started classes to become a teacher. now, that was for him. he did so much better, good grades and excellents jobs. in short, he never lost the enthusiasm to be a what he wanted. some people migth say that you don t have to fail, that you have to be success all the time. they migth say that is not ok to fail. however, that s not true, you can fail it s going to make you strong. you are going to have experience and you re going to do things so much better. if you can t do it in the first then, go for the next, and next until you can finally make it. in summary, success consist and failing many times.",3.5,3.5,4.0,3.0,3.5,4.0,2.8172693252563477,2.76802396774292,2.7536439895629883,2.8595213890075684,2.8021762371063232,2.7696943283081055

"generaly saying,people do accomplish more if we are always doing something. in live if you don t want to do anything you will become blind to the society and be left undone because you have waste the day and time not doing accomplishing things with your live but focus on things that are not accomplishing your live. for example: playing video, twitter, face time, and snapshot. all these thing are waste your time all depends on the way it being use. and if you fall in that position of not accomplishing when you get older it s going to effect you. example: you will start rubbing,mudring because you didn t put your mind on accomplishing anything. it is also important to accomplish more. my reason for saying this is the more you do accomplishment the more you go farward in anything. for example; by making good grade in school, by being a good leader, and also helping people if they do needs help all these things you are accomplishing something. everybody do want to accomplish something in life but you have to work for it. to be sucessful you have to accomplish everything in life. any people in this world today, have gotten good position for their accomplishment. i know, some time it s hard to do but like i said if you want to accomplish something in life you have to work for it. for example: like the brids we see today they have to go through a lot of stages. bruds cannot just be born and start to fly the same day they have to go through before they fly. so they accomplish their flyinh by process and it is the same as human we go through processes to accomplish things we want. our lives go by days and hours the day we see today will never return so why not accomplish somehting within that day because when that day is gone you have waste thime,and abilities to accomplish something. lets be honest the world today need someone that never give up. it is amazing for some one to reward you for your accompishment. today many of us went to be a doctor,lawyer, and so on but, we are not putting the effort and time. one way to accomplish thing in live is this pay attention to things, learn from mistake using your time and effort if you found yourself doing this you are going to accomplish many thing. the reason why many poeple don t accomplish things is this they don t pay attention not willing to ascept their wrong doing and don,t use their time and effort. for example; i want to be a doctor i have to pay attention in biology class, read books, and also make good grade i am accomplishing what are want to do because are do it constanly and i love it to so that give me more intrest in doing it. therefore, to make the world a better place we have to do better talking by mouth and not putting to action",3.0,3.0,3.0,3.5,2.5,2.5,2.877729654312134,2.728184938430786,2.691246271133423,2.8974709510803223,2.660144090652466,2.697859525680542
"to begin, what are your thoughts on first impressions through peoples point of view? when two people interact with one another the impression is not always dependable because people are probably not themselves, people opinion change, people never have the same intellectual connection. for example generic_name went to the movies with his girlfriend generic_name, his mom generic_name, and his sister generic_name. generic_name tells generic_name to invite her boyfriend generic_name. generic_name interaction with generic_name was unpleasant, based on what generic_name saw their was a different perspective from one an other. days later at night the family reunites and the perspective change from what generic_name thought at first and what she thinks now. secondly, periodically all around the world people are not themselves when we first interact with them. their is always a fifty- fifty chance that people, will get to meet their real personality. why? first because they are starting to get to know new people. second they have no idea what to expect from people. third, some people do above and beyond to impress. now in days many people try to make a good impression to belong to a certain group. sometimes they are so use to doing it that they dont even recognize that is not their true self. society has a huge impact on how people have to impress one another that it make others be afraid to show who we truly are. however, peoples opinion change from time to time. visualize that we are going to the store just to buy one item. we end up buying more then one item what does that mean ? it means that are mind changes to what we want it to change to. we might set up a scenario in are minds to have very high expectations to those surrounding us ,when we are self don t have that confidence. for example generic_name was mad at generic_name for not going to the bank with her. so generic_namea said that they would no longer be friends. the next day she text her and said what time am i picking you up. their was a change of opinion from night to morning. lastly, people never have the same intellectual connection. when you first meet someone and we are aware we want to make a connection ,we try to have some conversation to talk about. for example when people have a right there connection is because they are interested and the same things as one another. when two people dont have the same to things to talk about other might think this person is not interesting enough. people would make comments like no , your not qualify to join this group, or anything that involves having to impress another person. in conclusion, first impression arent usually trustworthy because people are not themselves, people opinion change, and people never have the same intellectual connection. peoples thoughts will change eventually no mater if they had a good impression at first. first impressions never counts because we never know who might be fooling us for a job ,",4.5,3.5,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.3207345008850098,3.0528640747070312,3.183641195297241,3.2656328678131104,3.0561578273773193,3.1090896129608154
"have you ever participated in a extracurricular activity at school, did you enjoy it? in today s day and age there are tons of extracurricular activities and even maybe some you never heard about. its always nice to give something a try even if you have never done it before. you could even join something that you have already done before and that your good at. for example, if you are good at basketball you could join the basketball club and have fun doing what you like. i agree that students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity because they can gain new experiences, it could help with their health, and they can make new friends. my first reason that students should participate in extracurricular activities is that they gain new experiences. its always nice to try something that you ve never done before. for example, lets say you have no experience in cooking and theres a cooking club you can join. by joining that club you could learn about different foods and how to cook them. those cooking skills that you learned could take you a long way or help you with something simple like cooking you or somebody else some food at home. another example could be joining a club that has to do with the wild and things like nature. you could learn about things like how to make a fire or what plants are dangerous and which are not. there could even be some hands on experiences like fields trips to go camping or just explore the wilderness. these could help you if you ever wanted to go camping on your own later on in the future. these are just some of the things you would get to experience joining new clubs,there are so many more. my second reason that students should join extracurricular activities is that it could help with their health. if students join a club they will be surrounded by other students and this will help them stay socially active. instead of being at home in a dark room playing video game or on their phones, they could be talking other students and enjoying the activities in the club. its always nice to have people surrounding so that way your not alone. being alone could lead to things like depression or social anxiety and no student should have to go through any of those things. another way it could help with their health is by joining a sports club. by joining any sports club students will be getting at least forty minutes to a hour of daily exercise. this exercise that the students are getting could help them with things like weight loss or just trying to stay in shape. its always good to try and maintain good health and these are some great ways to do it. my third and final reason that students should participate in extracurricular activities is that they can make new friends. by joining these extracurricular activities students may meet other students they have never seen before. this could",4.0,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.0,3.8585169315338135,4.126364231109619,4.127447128295898,4.114923477172852,4.0916008949279785,4.073343753814697
"should the students work alone or work in group. students should work in group because they are going to have more ideas, they can help each other and, they can prepare their self for the future. student should work in group because they are going to have more ideas. for example the student can share ideas of the work with the group. student have a different mining of the topic and they more ideas about how to do the work. and the student have different point of view, so they are going to share the ideas to the group to finish the work more faster. in conclusion student should work in group because they are going to have more ideas. students should work in group because they are going to receive more help. for example if a student do not understand the work other group member can help them so that they can understand. if the teacher do not have the time because she is helping others student to help a group member they can support each other. and the student have different ways to do the work so they can help each other to finish the work more faster. in conclusion the students should work in group because they are going to receive more help. student should work in group because the student are going to prepare for the future. for example when they get out of school, and they have to work in a office with a group of people they are going to have the experience to share ideas and get and give support. when the student have a family they are going to support each other with the family member to solve any problem that they have in the way. in conclusion the students should work in group because the student are going to prepare for the future. student should work alone because they are going to their work independence, however; it is better to work in group because students can help each other. in conclusion for me the student in the school should working in group because they are going to have more ideas, more help and, they can prepare their self to the future.",3.5,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,4.0,3.4052226543426514,3.1786000728607178,3.1859381198883057,3.309793710708618,3.0657799243927,3.213165760040283
"there are so many ways of influences people and i think the main one is to set an example by your own character. i agree with philosopher, physicain, and humanitarian albert schweitzer saying that ""is setting a good example by your own behavior the best way to influence other people."" for instance, most people look up to others to better them self by using thier action or behavior. first and foremost, you having a better behavior help others reflect on you to better their self. mostly, student or collegues look up to pass student who had accomplished something good and make them determined so they can also achieve something by taking hard classes to pass. due to the pass student behavior on thier education who set an impact on others telling them they can do it. is kind of having them as their motivator. i look up to people behavior and tell myself i can be more than that person due to his behavior. most of them, encourage me to be who i want to be and to achieve my goal. secondly, it leads them in the right path and it depends on thier action. your action towards your behavior matters, it depends on how you act towards a good behavior. if your action are good towards a good behavior it leads to the right path. emmulating someones behavior or action can help you be in the right path. most of the times we look up to people who have or had been who we want to be and then pick thier footsteeps by learning from their good behavior. for example, looking at lebron james, famous basketball player, looking at his games played can help you to be motivated and lead you to the right path of your goal. looking up to a famous person and following his footsteps emmulating his behavior set a good example to others. in conclusion, setting a good behavior or example kind of influence people so they can be on the right path and kind of know to set up a good behavior for someone else to follow. i take the stand and agree with phiosopher saying is setting a good example by your own behavior the best way to influence other people.""",3.0,3.0,3.5,2.5,3.0,3.5,3.6357240676879883,3.4993436336517334,3.496511220932007,3.5210177898406982,3.4459407329559326,3.536309242248535
"the world is full of new things that can help make you an outstanding person. trying something new will help you grow physically and mentally. even if you don t believe you can do it, you can always try and see. i will prove that trying new things above your skill can make any person grow. attempting something above what you already mastered can make you the best at whatever you love to do . if i was playing soccer for example, there are many positions to try. if i am already a great striker, why not try playing a defender position that i have never thought to do. this will make me a valuable asset to my team and i will grow with new skills. you can even grow academically by trying new things. it can t hurt to try something hard once in a while. when i am learning math, it doesn t make sense to try and understand a concept that won t make a difference to me, but it prepares me for harder problems in the future. if i do a difficult problem that i can t grasp, it is said that it only helps my problem-solving skills. there is no reason why it s not possible to master difficult problems. other would say that some people have limits to their abilities. they argue that a person who is stuck can not grow. they are wrong because it s not so much a person can t grow but don t have the support or energy to want to be able to achieve higher. sometimes they have have issues with their self-esteem. i believe that every person can grow to a certain extent. in conclusion, i agree with author ralph waldo emerson on his statement. a person that does not try new things above their own abilities will never grow. based on my experiences, i understood that trying something i never mastered will only make me grow as a person.",3.0,3.5,4.0,4.0,3.5,3.5,3.840611696243286,4.23736047744751,4.2710161209106445,4.087320327758789,4.155465126037598,4.22276496887207

"even in classroom everything catch student s attention! do you think students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home? i strongly believe that there is no benefits from attending to classes from home. next i am going to illustrate three reasons for saying that. first, by taking online classes at the end of the semester students do not learn anything. second, students most of the time get distract very easily, they don t focus on what they are suppose to be focusing on. last , is more convenient when someone is teaching you literally face to face. to begin with, sometimes students don t learn anything in classroom imagine in front of a computer. in other words, being at home students will do everything in a rush just to finish it quickly and go do something else. another consequence is that they will not put any interest in the classes and later, when the time to show your knowledge comes, they will not know what to do. for example, in my case when i am learning something something in the computer i feel like the light of the computer blocks my mind. to continue, is very easily for students to get distracted by something. taking online classes at home means having access to any electronic device to distract them like, cell phones, same computer that you are using, tv, etc. for example, sometimes when your family sees you at home they will tell you to take care of your siblings; the student will have to be supervising the kids and not focusing enough in the classes. imagine that in the classroom friends distract students at home that will be more terrible because young students always have friends playing video games at their home. at last, is more convenient to be learning in a classroom where you can see the teacher. for example, in my case i like to interact with the teacher and my classmate about the topic that we are learning, to get better understanding and sometimes to get other viewpoints. therefore, is more efficiently to be seeing the teacher literally teaching you to get all the knowledge needed to pass the classes. most of the time that students are learning somethings in the computer they tend to forget it right away. in conclusion, being in a classroom and interacting with the teacher and classmate is the best way of learning, getting all the information needed to pass the classes. by taking online classes at home the only thing that is going to happen is losing the semester by not being able to score what is needed to pass. electronic distraction is more available at home and get students attention very easily. attending to a classroom is more convenient and better way of learning and get educated the way it should be. it is not just about classes but also how to interact with people and and everything that is needed outside in the world to be educated and successful in life.",4.0,3.5,3.5,3.5,2.5,3.5,3.866154193878174,4.128458023071289,4.1798834800720215,4.092820167541504,4.077650547027588,4.056466102600098

"have you ever did something because is on trend or just because someone else did?. as you must know humans are easily influenced by others way of thinking and acting and it is because we want other people to like us showing that humans are social individuals. the best way of influencing others is setting an example by ourselves because we tend to compare ourselves to other people, also humans repeat what they like like the fashion trends, and lastly, because social pressure can lead us to do things even if we don t want to just because everyone else did. everyone is influenced by what others thinks or do. first, we have to begin with the way in which we usually compare ourselves to other people. is common that if we see someone breaking the rules we ll claim that ""we are on our right to do it to"" . or we can just see that this happens a lot between siblings; if one of the siblings gets something the other one will want the same. for example, when my parents buy something for my brother, i want them to buy something for me to. or when they let my brother be out until a late hour, i ll claim that i have the right to do the same the next time i go out. people is always comparing themselves to others in what they have or don t have. next, is imperative to analyze the humans dependence in wearing what others wear just because is in trend. if for example gigi hadid wears sweat pants with heals and looks good, every girl in the world would run to buy the same clothes and wear them because now is a trend; or if a girl in my school wears makeup in some way and i liked how it looked, i ll copy the look and wear it some other day. humans like parrots repeat what they like. finally, the social pressure can make us do things we don t want to just because someone else did. that is why many times we ve heard "" if other people jumped from the bridge, will you do it to?"". for example if we are on a party and someone offers a drink, the probability of drinking it is high because everyone else is doing it, and we want people to like us. if someone challenges us, we would do it because we want people to like us. social pressure is an influence in what people do. in conclusion, setting an example on our own will help us a lot in making people do what we want them to do. a smile is contagious, kindness is contagious and humans as social individuals repeat what they like and humans want people to like them.",3.5,3.0,4.0,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.8765437602996826,3.921226978302002,3.996398687362671,3.927063226699829,4.01050329208374,4.041242599487305
"dear school principal, i believe that students should have cell phones in campus. if they have something they always wanted from a school. they ll be wanting to learn more. if there s a emergency somewhere where they cant get to the office immediately , they could use there cell phones to call other students to tell the teachers that there s an emergency. parents won t be angry about this policy because they ll know that there children are learning in ways that they ll want to learn. so, if they know that they can use there cell phones in school they wont be using it during class hours. cell phones are really use full to students during school hours. it keeps them safe and will help there education in how they will want to learn. you should really reconsider to allow students to bring there cell phones to school. it will be helpful to them. students will think that education is fun now. and if you really look at it there s not much time of break or free time. the only time they ll use their phones a lot is during lunch time. take my opinion and try it . you ll see that i was right. our school will be fun for students our age. parents might want to bring there younger children to this school when they get older.",2.5,3.5,3.5,3.0,4.0,3.5,3.5686070919036865,3.6481456756591797,3.5269532203674316,3.6004371643066406,3.4951870441436768,3.542664051055908
"when you play activities or an instrument, don t you get a relief when you play them? i like to play volleyball, because i can make new friends, it gives me an opportunity in life to have a good life, and it is really fun to hit the ball when it flies really close to you. my first reason is that i can make new friends. having friends is an amazing thing, because you can always rely on your friend and have some kind of connection to them. friends will help you at any time, whether it is hard times, bad grades, fight with someone, arguments and others. friends are always there for you and it does not need to be a daily conversation with them to be friends. if you have friends, you will have more success in your life and it will give you new opportunities in life, such as, jobs and etc. when you become friends with someone, you become a different person and everyone around you are happy and you also can make a difference in the world if you have more opportunities to have a great life. my second reason is that the games give me more opportunities to participate in any activities that i am interested in. doing activities is good, because it keeps you healthy and a more enjoyable person. when you play sports it teaches you math, because the ball is circular and it has a circumference, radius, and a diameter. people don t just play sports, they play sports, because they enjoy them and when you play it, it feels like that you are free and able to do anything in the world. when you believe you can do it, you will be able to do it, you just don t need to give up if something goes wrong. my third reason is that it is fun to hit the ball when it flies towards you. it is fun, because it give you new experiences and different feelings that you have never had felt before. but to play a sport you have to have good grades and a good spirit of wanting to play the game. sports are like your new life, because when you start playing, you cannot stop. it feels like you are addicted to the game and that it is so fun that you cannot stop playing it. when you are in a team, it gives a different feeling, because you have to work hard to get into the team. you don t just go and play a sport, it has to include how hard enough you have worked to play in that sport. my fourth reason is that you should never give up on any sport, if you already started it. sports also give a different point of view of people. having feelings is a really good experience, because it shows a whole different part of our personality. sports give you a life experience that you will never forget, even if you are old. and, whenever you feel along",4.0,3.5,3.5,4.0,4.0,3.5,3.8451321125030518,3.896624803543091,3.9063830375671387,4.078120231628418,3.8513176441192627,3.9172708988189697
"the first place i would want to go is the bahamas because it seems like a wonderful place to go. thats the only place i dream of going. i would like going to the bahamas because the sea life there. i like watching animal shows to see all the different colors,patterns and different types of fish in the sea. i also like turtles because they walk slow and they look cool. the first thing i would do when i arrive at the bahamas is buy goggles then go to the beach and run in the water to find memo and dory. i would probably document everything so when i get back home i ll have a memory from when i was at the bahamas. i enjoy watching colorful fish swimming in crystal clear water. i like when there are all types of colorful fish in groups and swimming together. i also like stingrays because some of them flop on water and it makes it look like they are flying. there are also sharks for example bull sharks,blue sharks ,and mako sharks. i also like the coral because they come in different shapes,sizes and colors. the coral i like the most is the coral that the clown fish hides in. i would love to go on a cruse and see dolphins and stingrays. i would love to visit with my family one day. i also like dolphins because they look cool when they jump out the water and they dive back in. it will be cool if i learn how to surf in the bahamas because it fun to explain to your friends that the first place you learned to surf at is the bahamas. i bet if you stay there for a whole week you wont want to leave. i would probably be in to photography because of the sunsets and the beautiful place. it must be nice living there your whole life because of the nature.",2.5,3.0,3.0,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.7277069091796875,3.680551052093506,3.5507500171661377,3.901684522628784,3.6788320541381836,3.62037992477417
"i agree with john lubbock statement about ""your character will be what you yourself choose to make it"" because in order for you to get to your career , you want to have very good character traits. for an example , you love working with kids , so you apply working at a daycare center where you ll teach little kids the different types of shapes and watch them while their parents are at work. you apply and get schedule for an interview and the owner in charge looks over your resume and realizes you have bad character traits , do you think that they ll give you the job ? no they wont because they want someone who has good character traits. another reason , your character shouldnt be decided by the world or your friends. your character is something you show to somebody like loyalty and respect. if your loyal to someone chances are they ll be loyal to you. for an example a hospital hires you to be a general surgeon most likely they want you to stay loyal to them and stay with them. respect goes a long way , respecting someone is very important you never want to get in someones bad side because you never know what they ll do if you disrespect them. you want to always respect someone. your character is something that is chosen by yourself never the world, because you could be a very good person and you ll still have people talking down on you , but you choose to accept the fact that people are always going to have their own opinion. the world shouldnt decided if your a good person or a bad person society shouldnt decide that either. you choose to either be mean , rude , nice , happy , or sad. your character shouldnt be based on the people around you. they shouldnt have to choose your attitude. even though people think that your character is formed by influences beyond our control , i think we control our own character , we choose to either to be mean or nice. we control what goes through our head and what comes out of our mouths. the people around us should respect our character. we decided what we want to do for ourselves not others.",4.0,3.0,4.0,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.729551315307617,3.617601156234741,3.688977003097534,3.6764395236968994,3.619654417037964,3.6518592834472656
"do you agree or disagree about imagination being more important than knowledge ? i believe its important to get peoples opinions on this question because i think albert einstein would be curious about what people think. once they have chose what they chose they could talk about it, give each other some details, also communicate with another, ask questions on to why they chose what they chose. i disagree wit albert einstein because imagination is something you imagine in your head or dreams it can be real only sometimes. i agree with knowledge because it happens in real life and when you do something you have the knowledge to know it right away. students use their knowledge in school to learn about english. in school i use my knowledge by reading books and by reading i can understand what the book is talking about and i will know how i will write a short summary of the book. my second detail is i can use my knowledge in soccer because i can learn new skills and read a book all about soccer and i can understand that i can use my knowledge by knowing what reading is. imagination wouldnt be more important than knowledge because the things that you will imagine probably wont come to real life. imagination isnt a smart way to use the word important because it wont really help students, maybe even adults. knowledge i know that its a smart way to say important because it does help students in school, sports, maybe even with some decisions they will make in life. albert einstein probably asked us to agree or disagree with him because he wants to know what are thoughts are and would want students, adults, teachers to communicate with each other and talk about why they agreed or disagreed with him. in my conclusion i think students can succed in life using knowledge because its a smart decision to make in life by just thinking if its a good or bad idea your knowledge could help make that good decision for you",3.0,3.0,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.5,3.69124436378479,3.7007153034210205,3.5533955097198486,3.8281214237213135,3.640408992767334,3.6524720191955566
"the author waldo emerson wrote ""to be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment"". i agree with waldo emerson s quote because if theres someone thats trying to make you something that your not, being yourself will be a very duanting task. when i was in the th grade someone who i thought was one of my friends wanted me to change who i was because they though that i was nt cool enough to hangout with anymore, at first i thought that i was the problem, but i learned that true friends won t try to change who you are, no mather what. being yourself is one of the hardest things you can try to do, possible because your to shy, you don t think your good enough, your scared of what others will think of you. i always hated thinking about myself because i never though that i was good enough for anyone or good enough to do anything, so i kept everything bottled up inside, at one point or another i even thought about killing myself but was to scared to do antthing to try anything. so i decided acted like everything was ok untill i tricked my self into belaveing that i was happy, but that did nt last. now i m in the th grade i came across a certen individuality(my current girlfriend) who, when i around, can t stop feeling real happyness. everyday i think about how lucky i am to have met her. the author ralph waldo emerson wrote ""to be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment, as an individual i agree with his quote because in this world not everone wants to see you sucssed in your efferts.",3.0,4.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.192962408065796,3.055238962173462,3.0814266204833984,3.1906089782714844,3.004075765609741,2.969353199005127

why is it when someone asks you for advice there the one s talking most of the time? here are of the reasons i think that the person who asks for advice talks more than the one who is giving the advice. reason is they might want to give the on who is giving the advice all the info so then they can help them. reason is that they are give you as much detail as they have to give you good advice. they will want to give you all the information so you can probably find a solution or fix to there problem. as in this sit ions where my friend needed some advice for a test she had coming up. she was not sure what to do to study for it. she was telling me what she had to study but then she said i dont think these would help me much i told her to make flash cards out of the note she had then she did that. she was super stress. i think when your stressed you just say things that are on your mind as in you talk more. if a person wants good advice they will want to give you all the details. if you know all the details you will most likely know how t fix it. everyone needs so good advice because the how are they going to fix there problem. if you friend has a problem and they dont tel you all the details your not really gonna give then good advice. in conclusion why you need advice you will talk more then the person who is given you the advice. when you are in a problematic event you will take a lot more because yo will be most likely stressed. also if you give all the the details of your problem you will get good advice.,3.0,2.5,3.0,3.0,2.5,2.5,3.322565793991089,3.1418752670288086,3.194678783416748,3.25628924369812,3.1552894115448,3.2308237552642822

"""a problem is a chance for you to do your best"", this phrase said by the american jazz legend duke ellington means that if you have a problem you can use it to improve yourself and i agree with this statement because problems can help you by making your brain grow up, giving you knowledge, and making your personality stronger. problems make your brain to grow up, imagine being on a math test and you don t know the answer, probably you will be scared but if you try hard to remember what is the answer you will find it, usually problems are too hard to solve and this fact helps you to make your brain to think a way to solve the problems, this can cause your brain to grow up by using all your energy to think in what you can do in this situation. problems gives you knowledge, there should be a reason for you to be in a problem, if you fight in the school or anywhere with another person or you do something bad, probably someone will call you to the office or take you to the police department , if you are in a problem the first thing you will do is think on why this happened and this helps you because you will know what you did bad and will not do it again. problems makes your personality stronger, if you crash your car you may feel bad and scared for this event, i had a test that it was hard and in that moment i felt bad, so most of the time when you have a problem you will feel stressed, this stress can be bad for your brain but it can also help you to be more patient and determined in your goal that is solving your problem, with this two things your personality will be stronger that before the problem. in conclusion, i think that duke ellington is right because problems can help you by making your brain grow up, giving you knowledge, and making your personality stronger. so if you are in a problem you should take the lead of this situation and be determined in solving it, is not the end of the world only because you have a problem, and now you know that problems can help you.",3.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.5810248851776123,3.402200222015381,3.4485297203063965,3.5558385848999023,3.4498822689056396,3.4599668979644775
"people really work on this this? or people knows the importance to be better every day? people didn t know the importance to learn more, like give to their mind more wisdom and they just conform with small pieces and i very agree with this statement because it s true that if you dont learn more than you already know, you don t be able to be successful in life and i was wrong all the time and it s sad for me just realize that i waste a lot of time doing nothing and this question makes think a lot and the reason why is because i never think about to do something much better that i did already and sometimes if i have to do it, im afraid to fail or do something wrong but small things do the difference and know something more that you already do it gives you more opportunities in life and you grow more. try something new that you never done before it s something scary for humans it doesn t matter the age or how brave you are, if you had a lot difficulties doing it; probably you will be scare if you have to do it again even if you already know how to do it for example, i been working in a japanese restaurant about one year and half and it was the first time for me working as a server and i was scare to do it and the reason why i decide to do it was the money, and i got surprise of myself because i made it and my boss was telling me that i was doing really good job and i felt so proud of my self because at that time my english wan t perfect and after i m got problems with him about money and it was too much problems, so i decide get another job my friend told me that her boss was looking for new servers so i went to apply but the problem was when i saw the size of the restaurant and the different with the other restaurant was a lot and also when i saw the menu in mind i was saying "" you will fail"" i feel too bad that day, and all the progress was long and suffering for all the mistakes that i made but i made it one more time and today i thinking all that i went through it was t that much difficult and i m not a master but i m still learning. many people are conformist with their life and dont want to learn more and unfortunelly i m include in that group of people and it happens to me that i fail many times because i think already know everything even more than others for example, one day i was taking a spanish test and felt confident about it because my first language is spanish and i remember the majority of my classmates were studying for that test but wasn t and",2.5,2.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,3.5,2.8144404888153076,2.7050857543945312,2.6951448917388916,2.8665196895599365,2.6878793239593506,2.6748783588409424
"what is positive attitude? positive attitude is when a person has positive thoughts about something that went wrong or good, but they see all the possibles ways to success in life. having a positive attitude is essential in lifestyle, this can bring happiness to your life, and can take you to extraordinary places. i think having a positive attitude is important because this is a way to express yourself around others, and to show the way you can manage your thoughts. i agree that having positive attitude is the key to success in life, and that everyone should have a positive attitude not just for a work area but anywhere. there are many reasons to have a positive attitude, for example: you may want to have a positive attitude when you get a bad grade on the test, because you can think positive and say: "" i did bad on this test today but, i am going to keep trying and studying hard every time so i can do better"". another example is when you are doing a sport and you think you can t do it and that you are going to give up, you can tell yourself you can do it and have a positive attitude towards it. there are always problems in the daily life, and people deal with this problems not always with a good attitude. what will happen if you don t have a positive attitude? well if you don t have a positive attitude, you won t have success in life because you are going to have negativity in your mind and the word ""fail"" is going to become one of your favorites. having a positive attitude is not always easy, and not all people have it. a negative attitude is the opposite of a positive attitude, and this can affect your life. for example: in school if you have a bad attitude things can go bad, when you are always being negative usually your problems don t get fix and you struggle more with your thoughts. this can mentally affect you, and teenagers are challenged every day by this issue. the key is positively to a succesful life. i personally consider myself as a postive person. i try to solve every problem with a positive attitude because when i do so, my problems get fix the good way and i am happy with the results. if i don t have a postive attitude, all my goals would be nothing, i get stress and change my attitude, and i even hurt people s feelings without knowing. success is important too because by this you can be a better person for society, people can judge you differently and you can help others when they are going through a lot. positively is also mental strength, it expands your knowledge, it changes the way you think about everything, and makes your life easier. in conclusion, having positive attitude helps you to have success in life. sometimes it s hard to understand how people can be so positive about everything,",4.0,4.0,4.0,4.5,4.5,5.0,3.598435163497925,3.360032796859741,3.396649122238159,3.5112202167510986,3.4479825496673584,3.489668130874634

"should you relied on yourself or other about life s important matters? its important that people relied on their own instincts and ideas because if we have people picking chooses for others we would have no power on what we want, for example people who learn from them self are more active and confidant then the ones that have to learn from other, and wait for instructions. i belieave that people should relied on them selfs for two reasons. my first reason is that every one makes mistakes, and thats were we learn to not do them again. infact when you make mistakes is better because you get to try again and you get to do it even better, there for to succesed in life you will have to fall, and get back up in to your feet to try again and do it better. my second reason is that if you let others choose for you, you will never learn to deal with hard thinking situations. also you get to learn more about your self and you get to do stuff your own way and you also learn to love your self from your mistakes. i think that every person should make there own choose when it comes to hard momemts like when my grandma die my parent pick what we was going to do with her, and she didnt go ask some one what to do, no she knew what to do from expiriens of my grate grandma, and thats why some problems have to be dealt by your self. in conclusion its important that people learn to think and do things own there own so they wont spend money on others telling them what to do, and also not relied on somes help from others, some chooses are hard and some are easy but every choose you make, makes you up and shows who you really are.",3.5,3.5,3.0,3.0,2.5,3.5,2.6615700721740723,2.5860843658447266,2.566663980484009,2.7134969234466553,2.603663682937622,2.6110501289367676

"students get their longest break on summer when they finish the first ten months of the school year; however, they will forget the information they have been taught in school when they get back in fall if they spend this long vaccation for only partying, going for a trip, or without taking classes online. also those people who argue that there should be a year round schools and summer should be a - weaks break, it will be a less time break for most students who have planned to do their own projects while reading and without forgeting what they have learned. first, when students complete thier school year and started planning what to do for thier summer vaccation, spcially teens will put partying on the first list. there are some students who are doing worse than this, doing nothing but waiting for their friend s party. students don t realize that they are wasting thier time on partying untile the coming scholl year approaches. this doesn t just waste their time on thier vaccation when they can take classes online or school closer to where they live in but they are wasting thier money instead of saving it for their college tutition. second, when someone goes for a trip, they will observe information and learn from what they have seen when travelling. on the other hand, when students are going for a trip, most of them will be taking pictures of themselves only without paying attention, observing ideas, or learning from what they see on the trip. if they were paying attention when travelling without just taking pictures of themselves, they were going to get benefitted for some classes like history and geography. third, in the summer long vacation if students are not going to summer schools or studying at home, they definetly should be taking online courses to help them not to retain information as easily when they return to school on fall. when students are not studying ortaking classes over the summer, their brain is not developing which makes them not to be a creative or open minded. plus, it is hard for most students who was enjoying summer without taking classes and getting back to school when it opens to understand like other students who have taken summer schools in their long vacation. in conclusion, i don t agree with the idea that there should be year round schools to prevent students from not retaining information when they return to new school year from their summer vacation. instead of creating a year round schools, students can enroll themselves to summer school and study with their parents support. additionally, if there is a longer winter break in the middle of the schools year, students most likely will forget what they have been taught before even finishing the full school year. furthermore, long summer vacation is helpful to complete what one student has planned. as the matter of fact, even if there is a - week break in the summer, students will still not retain information easily when school starts",4.0,4.0,3.5,4.0,3.5,3.5,3.7189621925354004,3.691004753112793,3.74407696723938,3.853843927383423,3.776597023010254,3.7590672969818115

"working in a group is better people in this days are deciding rater to work in a group or work alone. there is a lot of good and bad things between these two options. most people may choose to work in groups for differents reasons. here are some of the reason why i think that working in group in better than working alone. some people like to work in groups because they like to finish faster, also it is a good choice because the information taht you need to look for is divide with all the group members, finally it is good because you meet new people in the group to work with. the first reason why working in a group is better than working alone is because you can finish faster. for example if you work by your-self on a big project you are going to take more time to finish it. probably you can finish it on time but you are going to spend a lot of time then you. then if you work in a group everybody in the group can hellp to get it done more fast. with the help of all the members the work is going to be done on time and you are going to have more time for yourself. with more time for yourself you can play video games, watch your favorite show or take a good time to study for another class or a test. another reason why working in a group is a benefit rater than work alone is because you divide the information about the topic with all the members of the group. for example if you are in high school and you get a big project then there is two choices to do it by yourself or work in group. i think most people in your class will prefer to work in groups because there will be a lot of information to look for. in a group all the members are going help in the project to get a good grade. everybody are going to be proud of what they did together. also they can be the best project on the class. the last reason why working in groups is better than working alone is because everybody in the group meet new people. for example in your class you do not talk to all your classmates and this is a good opportunity to talk to them. maybe in the past you were thinking that they were bad people but doing the project together that let you know that they are awesome. meeting new people is good because sometimes others may feel alone and letting yourself meet them and letting them meet you, both are going to feel a different way. sometimes what we just need is a good friend to talk and to do homework with. some people are going to be disagree with this idea because they may not like to meet new people or because they like to be by their selves. in conclusion working in groups is",4.0,3.0,3.5,4.0,2.5,4.0,3.6596670150756836,3.4606549739837646,3.491109848022461,3.5637362003326416,3.4943230152130127,3.497812509536743
"is it true that a positive attitude is a key to success in life?. well, success is a strong word, there are some people that do not get where they want to be because the way they think. our actions depend on how our thinking is. it is true that a positive attitude is a key to success in life, if you have a goal and you really work hard to achieve it , you are always thinking ""i can do it"" and you are being positive about it, you have the idea that you will get whatever you want to get. in addition there are many people who really want to get something or get to somewhere, but their minds are always thinking negative, they feel like they will not do good or they will not success, it makes them not keep trying. for example, when i was in middle school i had a classmate who will always think he was a ""looser"" he will always said that he could not do anything, his parents did not love him, so many horrible things that will make feel sad, i always tried to make him feel better by saying positive things about him, but i thing that is all about the ideas we put in our minds. success depends on our actions too,sometimes we let other people decide for us, we either do what they said or we act the same way they act. some of this people do not have a positive attitude to help you success. we create a plan that we have to work on to be successful, even though that we need to have a positive attitude. we have to make it happen no matter what, try as hard as you can! because if you just have a positive attitude but you are not trying hard an off, is not worth it, i seemed some people that are very good at something because thats all and the only thing they do :however they don t try to keep going further, and when they are in a situation that things are more challenging they give up! in conclusion; a positive attitude is a important key to success in life, on how comfortable you feel about yourself, and how successful you will be.",2.5,2.5,3.0,2.5,3.0,3.0,3.661653995513916,3.433094024658203,3.429502010345459,3.645185708999634,3.468197822570801,3.473318099975586

"imagine walking into a classroom full of children just glaring at you, ans you teaching them a lesson that they have never heard of. a lesson i would teach to elementary students is about being active in life and why its s important to be active in life and it s,doing sports or or a physical activity, eating healthy, and going to the gym. doing a sport is very important, because you are getting the excercise you need and loosing weight. it is very important sports if your a child, because children are young and energetic, so it is good for them to run around. kids don t have to do sports, they can just go ride a bike around the neighborhood, go for a daily jog, and go ride a skateboard. this could be there daily exercise or weekly excersie. eating healthy is very important, because you won t have a high chance of getting diabetes or heart diesease. kids should eat there vegtables too, because it won t make you gain alot of weight. in my opinion i think vegtables are better than fruits. children need to stay away from sugar, salt, and greasy food, because if you consume those types of foods it causes high blood presure, which gives you headaches. this could benefit for the rest of their lives. kids should go to the gym once in a while, because they can go on a tredmill for minutes. kids should lift dumbells also, becuase it gets them stronger, and they could lift them at any size. box jumps are perfect for leg strength, and it helps you with your athlecticism and vertical. the gym is perfect for a exercise routine. i would teach elementary students about sports and why they need to do it, because it could benefit your life, and going to the gym is an even greater way to stay in shape.",3.5,4.0,3.5,3.5,4.0,3.5,3.422384738922119,3.3914806842803955,3.3323750495910645,3.279489755630493,3.3283779621124268,3.3592188358306885
"to begin with, there are different opinions about to do something beyond of what we have already mastered and for that reason we will never grow. some people idea is that if they have already their master they will stop there, but thats not the point. i believe that we have to keep trying and learning until the end ; for example, if you never try something different you will never grow. im agree with author ralph emerson and here are my reasons why: one reason, is you will have more experience. experience make people rich and i am not talking about profit. for example, if i go to apply for a job and i just have a high school diploma because all i wanted was a high school diploma, but there is another applicant that have more than a high school diploma he also have a diploma as a plumber. this applicant have more experience and more masters, he prepared himself more than me , so he will get the job. sometimes in life we have to be ambitious in a property way. i am agree with author ralph because learning differently means growing. the reason is i will be more mature, for example ; i will gain more mature because i have learned based of my mistakes, moreover will be easier for me than another person that just stayed with the easiest. there are many people that give up at the first try; although, life is not easy but at least dont give up at: the first, second and the third try. another reason why trying something new of what i already have is i can reach more goals; in other words, at this time in society your value depends a lot on what you have, you can more privileges if you have more goals earned. for example, my goal is to be a police officer but after i reach my goal i will keep looking for a highest range, and that will make me grow: economically, physical and mentally. in addition, while you are mastering new goals you will be growing at the same time. in conclusion many people is not agree to this idea because many of them like the easier, but the easier is not valuable .there will be many obstacles, and people will think that is the end; consequently, they will not grow sufficiently to know that the most they try the most opportunities of gain they have. however, in my opinion is never late to continue learning because; the more we learn that more we know, and the more we know the more we grow .",3.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.5,3.7196645736694336,3.577866554260254,3.678684949874878,3.632438898086548,3.603860855102539,3.5621719360351562
"first of all, we all know that self -reliance define it as the need for each individual to follow an own instinct and idea, but people should always seek guidance from experts and authorities about life s important matters, so people can compare between his decision or the expert s idea and advice. although some people always make their own decision because some usually believe that they are always thinking clear and positive, actually the best for people is to always seek guidance from an expert or authority because somehow it can help all the people to compare between an own decision or the expert s advise or guidance to finally find out what is the best choice and seek guidance from experts can easly contribute when people want to consider to take an action on an important decision. some people always make their own decision because some usually believe that they are always thinking clear and positive. as it has been proved, people naturally believe that they are always correct on their decisions so it make humans feel that others are not reliable even when is a family or friend. actually it is the best for people to always seek guidance from an expert or authority because somehow it can help all the people to compare between an own decision or the expert s advise and guidance to finally find out what is the best choice. somethimes people is not really sure when or how to take an action on a decision and it can make you fell upset or depress, but there is always people we can trust and feel confortable to ask them for an advide or guidance, and at the end we can just try to find out what is more convinient and what will make us improve our ideas. in addition, seek guidance from experts can easly contribute when people want to consider to take an anction on an important decision, according to new research. having other s people ideas makes the brain think twice and take a better position on any issue for example; when people have a problem about life s important matters, the brain does not think clear and it makes people not think twice about their thinking that can be completly wrong, but if we seek guidance from a reliable person that will give us an extra point of view and extra ideas that we might use to take an action on an important decision. people should always seek guidance from experts and authorities about life s important matters because it can help people to compare between their thoughts and expert s advice when people want to consider to take an action on an important decision, even though many people make their own decisions. seek guidance from experts or authorities will help you to take a better position on any issue.",2.0,2.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.546269416809082,3.600952625274658,3.703739881515503,3.616368293762207,3.576474666595459,3.6565232276916504

"" maybe she will stop crying. lastly,parents always said "" you can t find a nice job that you want by having your imagination."" i think you can find a job with your imagination. for example, if you want to be a home designer but you don t have imagination. you make the house so horrible. you will got fired and you can t earn money. on the other hand, if you want to be writer and you can imagine lots of things and create or more excellent books. you can earn lot of money even earn more that a doctor. so, i think imagination can find a really nice job that you want. to sum up, i totally agree with scientist albert einstein.

"dear generic_name, it has come to my attention that schools have partnerships with companies that allow students to explore certain occupations trough interships and shadowing opportunities, to discover whether they are interested in pursuing that type of job. however i m in favor of the new opportunities that the schools are offering to young teenagers. allowing students to explore certain ocupations would motivate students to decide what type of job they want to dedicate their life on. every student dreams to have a perfect job, were they can have a good enviorenment and do what they love to do, but for many other reasons; students do not have the same opportunities as other s. with the new chances that companies are offering to students, everyone has the choice to be what they want and be succesful in life. every student goes trough a hard process were they have to decide, what they want to become in life. as a result not everyone gets the job they wanted to, causing that this person feels miserable working in a place were they don t feel comfortable. many juniors and seniors are feeling the pressure deciding what type of job they want; however companies allowing students to discover what their passion is and what type of job they want to get,would increase the percentage of students achieving their goals and get the job they wanted to. not every student has the chance to get the job they want to. either way because they don t have the sources to reach their goals or they can t because they are not well stablish financially. for example, my dream is to become a doctor but no one of my family have gone to collage, they don t have any expierence nor the sources to help achive my dream. i believe i m not the only one that is going trough this, schools partenerships with companies benefits everyone in many differente ways, causing that every student has the chance to succed in life. lastly, allowing students to have the will to explore new opportunities benefit those who are still deciding what they want to become in life, and those who don t have any chance on achieving their goals. it s very important that every teenager prepares to the real world, without having any doubts or risking themselves to be unsuccesful. companies allowing students to choose what they want to be in life can be one of the many reasons that our future can be secure. thank you for taking your time on this matter and allowing me to express my opinion and my greatfullness. sincerely, generic_name",3.5,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.5,2.5,3.5116169452667236,3.442136764526367,3.405325412750244,3.443617582321167,3.3520560264587402,3.477559804916382

"although some say schools shouldn t offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home because students would not get enough educations away from school, actually students should have benefit from being able to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. however, some say school shouldn t offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home because students wouldn t get enough knowledge at home, it s better in school. actually, students should be able to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. first, online is useful in many ways. students can research the information, or students can watch video on youtube. for example, math, some students don t understand how to solve the equations, but they can watch the video and find more math learning. also, english essays. last year, my english teacher told me to write an essay about the night by eli wisely. i researched him because i didn t know who he was at first, and i found his history in the holocaust, i read it. it was very tragedy. so, i wrote it down for project, and i found a lot information in the holocaust. it was useful finding information on google. second, video conferencing is helpful. there is a website called edubirdie. this website is use for teachers communicating with students for education. students can spend time with teacher like hours or depends on what time students chooses. edubirdie helps students with essays, math problems, social studies, science, etc.. also, i remembered when i had a final exam for chemistry, and the problem was i didn t learned anything from chemistry class. because my teacher was horrible, i didn t learned anything from him. so, i searched to edubirdie website and watched some videos of stochiometry problem and word problems. then, i face timed a chemistry teacher from edubirdie. i spend like hours with her. it helped me little bit. after that, i took the final exam and i barely passed the class with the d+. at least i passed the class and i m happy with it. in conclusion, schools should offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing because it gains knowledge and helpful for future education.",3.5,3.5,3.5,4.0,3.0,3.5,3.75555419921875,3.555431604385376,3.4624156951904297,3.700014591217041,3.513704299926758,3.6432721614837646
"my grandma always said, "" is ok to fail, the only thing that matters is to stand up and keep trying."" a decision is the act of deciding something, as a controversy or question, by reaching a conclusion or making a judgment. if people take their own decisions, they are going to benefit. people should take their own decisions because it is a right, people can learn for the consequences of their actions, and people have the ability to think by themselves. many argue that people should visit a guidance to take decisions because guidance may have more experiences solving problems. however, they are wrong because in the past people fight and die for rights, and now that everyone have the privilege to talk for themselves they are not going to let others to decide for them. clearly, people do not need to visit a guidance in order to made a good decision. initially, citizens have the right to take their own decision. for instance, generic_name, who is a citizen of the united states, wants to get the divorce because he found his wife cheating on him. to specify, he went to the court to get the paperwork done for the divorce. to detail, he have the right and the privilege to get the divorce because it is human right; he do not need the help of any guidance to made this decision because is something too personal. one should observe that taking decisions is a right that everyone is able to reach. additionally, people can make mistakes, but they have the capacity to emend them. for example, generic_name, for peer pressure, take a wrong decision about using drugs. to add, she realize that what she did were a wrong decision, and she understood that is bad for her health and she staunch doing it. clearly, society can make people do what they do not want, but is in one to say: no; and fix what they did wrong. last, but not less important, everyone have different ideas and points of views, and because of that people should make their own decisions. for instance, generic_name s parents teach him to differentiate between good and bad; that means that he is not going to be in troubles for a bad decisions. to illustrate, he do not need the help of others to make a good choice. obviously, humans are unique and sometimes people do not going to agree with others, but that does not means that one is wrong and the other is right; people need to respect others decisions. in summary, taking decisions is a privilege that ancestors gave us, people are going to made mistakes in order to success, and everyone is qualify to talk by themselves. these prove that citizens should not need to see a guidance in order to made decisions. people must respect others points of views and do not judge them for what they do. there is only one choice: respect and always have present that no matter what others said you can do it!",3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.0,3.5,3.6290652751922607,3.402432918548584,3.465155839920044,3.5760843753814697,3.3576536178588867,3.5076985359191895

"students are expected to identify a career by the time they enter high school their courses of study on high school are selected to guide them toward a specific career to have a idea on what they want but a lot of the new students don t know what they really want in life because they are too young and some of them are not used to high school. when you are in a young age is difficult to choose what you really want it takes time to choose what you want or to choose a career at a young age because they don t have a lot of responsibility s at a young age a lot of them just think of having a playful and safer childhood. they are to young to just choose what want in life. when you are a teenager you don t have any idea about a specific career or you are not sure. a lot of students put a lot of pressure school: test, quizzes, homework, grades. and is very difficult for some students on specific all the athlete s: soccer players, basketball players, lacrosse player s track runner s, if they make it to the school team all of them have to spend four to five or more hours of just training and working on getting better. they don t have a lot of time for study or do the homework. a lot of young students have a lot of pressure to think on a career on a young age because some of them have problem like sleep problem s and school grades. all this young teenage s and student s need time to think about what career they really want. they need time to choose what they really want because if the student s just choose a career they are not going to like or be happy on that career they are not going to keep going. when you are on a young age you need something or somebody to help you to choose a career. you get need help to choose want you want is better to grow and spend more time thinking about what you really want. when you are on a young age is hard for you to just go to high school and choose a career that you really want in life, the school s should send help and talk to the students on what they want the should help them to choose something that they may like and bring specific people focus on that career to help them choose and get some examples for the students if the school s get that help and specific people to help them that should be a big help for the students and teenager s when you get help sometimes is more easy and can you help think about a career that you can be focus on overall teachers should bring specific people and get them example on that career. that they really want. is better to spend more time thinking on what",2.0,2.5,3.0,2.5,3.0,3.0,3.467811107635498,3.1341025829315186,3.0885088443756104,3.393141269683838,3.068671941757202,3.140648126602173
"it has been said that first impressions are almost impossible to change. in my opinion first impression might be possible to change because people are different human with different habits and it depends on ourselves how we act and treat the person that we want to impress. for example generic_name wanted to apply for a job in a clothing company named dior which is a popular,expensive,and fancy brand he prepares himself for his first interview,he wears black suit and black shoes and starts heading to the office with his cv he have enough expeirence to be one of the employer in the company he impress his boss and thats how he gets his job. in addition to this statement the reason why the first impression is impossible is because the people did not met each other more than once they do not know their habits what they like about each other or what they do in their daily life or what they like to do like their expeirence. in conclusion i would say this statement is kind of equal disagree or agree becuase like i said people never know each other habits and what they like for example: what is their hobby, what they eat,what they like to wear, so at the end my opinion is i am disagree with this statement.",3.5,2.5,3.0,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.857862949371338,2.6440775394439697,2.658942937850952,2.780540943145752,2.5773868560791016,2.705275058746338
"a city council is having arguments to adopt curfew for teenagers, p.m on weekdays and midnight curfew on weekends. some people thinks this to be a good idea,but others especially like young people does not think so. there are conflicting opinions over this topic. according to me this is a good idea to set a limit for teenagers who stay away from home late night. in my opinion,this adoption can lead to improvement in sleeping habits of teenagers,prevents unhealthy food habits and allow teens to spend more time with their families. curfews to stop teenagers going out of home late night make them improve their sleep time. as they are home they sleep on better time than they are out till midnight. for young people sleep time should be - hours atleast,because of their growing body structure. young people are more energetic if they sleep well. staying out late disturbs bed time for teens,which makes them lazy,tired and inactive in activities going on around us. unadequate sleep can also lead to risk in driving a vehicle. as you could not sleep well you may feel dizziness while driving a vehicle,which is really dangerous. a lot of teens die in road crashes because of unattentiveness while driving,this unattentiveness comes from unadequate sleep. also the crashes are caused due to drink and drive habits after staying out late night. to protect teens from death in that early age curfews should be adopted. as when me myself could not sleep well,i am unable to concentrate on my work in my class. this alot of times effects my grades. also when i stay awake till late night separates me from what is going on in real world because when people around me are awake,i am not focused and asleep. this adoption also somehow effects teens eating habits. staying out means eating unhealthy and junk food,which is not at all good for young people s health. along with adequate sleep we also should be healthy to stay fresh and active. it is really necessary for young people to eat healthy food because they have their full life to live and if they will stay unhealthy,they will get diseases in really early age. not only food when teens go out with friends they drink alcohol or beer, which is not good for them at that early age. unhealthy food weakens teens immune system which leads to diseases in quite early ages. not only diseases unhealthy food collects a lot of fat in their body that effects teens socially,mentally and physically. if teens stay in the house they eat food provided to them by their parents, also which is healthy and not too oily. whenever i eat unhealthy food it makes me sick and if you are in place where no one knows you,people there likes tyo stay away from me which makes me feel uncomfortable. i have seen a guy in my family who have grown fat after eating a lot of junk food,he suffers a lot of problems like he need someones help to get up if",3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,2.5,3.5,3.8454766273498535,4.066189289093018,4.135590553283691,4.101841926574707,4.14401912689209,4.098524570465088
"even though imagination is more important than knowledge, thinking in a creative way is better than learning something from somewhere. yes, imagination is more important than knowledge because it s letting your brain think more about the things that make you happy the most. also imagination is like thinking outside of the box (to me), but i try using imagination a little more than knowledge. although knowledge is not as good, but some people prefer knowledge instead of imagination. imagination helps me become more creative and open to myself because i let myself imagine, then let my mind speak free and be creative. becoming more creative and open is really good, knowledge does not give me the opportunities to do so. knowledge does not let me be as more creative as when i m imagining, therefore i have to start imagining. i think that imagination is a better way of saying art, because i m thinking of things that may not even exist in this world. in that case, imagining is creative, artistic, and beyond, so that is why imagining something is better than knowledge to me. imagination makes me passionate about what i want to do and accomplish it. i ve always dreamed of opening my own interior design company. that designs furniture,planing notebooks for office workers, etc, that are for houses, offices, and dorm rooms. all of that was because of imagination, i wanted to accomplish that when i graduate from college. imagination doesn t just help me with what i want to accomplish it also helps me decide what i want to be when i grow up. otherwise imagination would ve not gotten us to where we are right now. finally, imagination is something that brings people together like art and creative things. it also brings us joy and things that we don t really imaging on our daily bases. although, knowledge is not important than imagination i still think that knowledge can be used in someway and help me with something. therefore i thing that imagination is more important than knowledge because it help me with my daily bases work at school, home, sports and all kinds of other things that i do.",3.0,3.0,3.5,4.0,3.5,3.0,3.890620708465576,3.859915256500244,3.6554088592529297,4.062263011932373,3.9314141273498535,3.8879377841949463
"what would you do if you fail your online classes? some schools now offer online classes to make the student s life easier. i do not agree with the schools that offer distance learning, because it could be difficult for students to understand the online notes or videos, the students always need a teacher to ask questions, and the student s parents need to pay internet at home. also the internet is expensive and some parents can not afford. first, it can be beneficial for the students to attend at school because there is more activities and sports, where they can have fun with their friends. also, the teachers are always there to help and explain better the subjects. from my own experience, i need to be with a teacher to understand what is the topic about, that helps me to pass my exams and my classes. even thought, there is some teachers that are very strict and irritate the students but the teachers know that is beneficial for the students future. therefore, being at home the whole time it is so boring because the students need to be studding and not having fun. that is why some students cannot develop them knowledge because they do not take fresh air and entertain them minds with someone else. for example, my friend generic_name she is at the community college and the teachers offer some online classes and she decided to take it. but now she is frustrating because she have to watch some boring videos and she have to take quizzes constantly. she told me that she miss all her friends and her classmates. after all, certain student do not have their mind clear enough attending to school; now imagine how difficult would be for them to take online classes without a teacher. for example, generic_name was taking online courses because he got sick so he could not attend to school for one year. then, he came back to school, he was so disappointed because he mist a lot of stuff from his subject. he had to stayed after school and he had to go to summer school. well, so far i have not take online classes but i take my friends experiences that is not easy. finally, in my opinion is not a great idea that the students take online classes, if they want to move faster and achieve in the future. some teachers think that online classes is easier for the students, then attending to school because the students take them own time to study. but the consequences is when the students fail their subject and they had to take it again in school.

"imagination is a thing all of us have some persons have more imagination than others, but i think we all have it some where, like my mother say ""if you don t have imagination you would not be successful"". i agree with what the scientist albert einstein said the imagination is more important than knowledge because you can have more fun, and you can discover a lot of new things, also you can enjoy life more. to begin with you can have more fun because you can be really entertained while creating new things like when you start a new project you can have a lot of ideas, and you can enjoy explaining them, or drawing them, you can have fun too when you are making those ideas come to life because you imagine them just how you want them, and you can have fun too by learning in the process something like you may not know, and you can apply them on your project just by using your imagination because you are the only one who knows how you want it. also you can discover new thing maybe you would not know is the thing that you are creating could work, and there you can discover a lot of ways to work more well, or you can also discover, and learn more thing like what to use, or how to put thing right, but thats not the only thing, for what you can use your imagination for, you also can use it when you are drawing or writing histories like when you write you can discover a lot of knew words, or when you are drawing you can discover where you can put lines in the right spot, or at what measure, you also can discover how well you can draw. finally you can enjoy life more because you would not be so stressful, and you can enjoy imagine, and in my thoughts when you imagine you are in your own world you can imagine what ever you want, and you would not be worry about what the people is going to say about you i think i m an example of it because i like to draw a lot and when i m thinking about what i want to draw i always forget about everything, and i really enjoy drawing, and i also like to go out a lot because of that because when i go out i see a lot of thing and when i want to draw i always imagine them, and then i draw them more colorful than how i saw them and i really enjoy it. in conclusion imagination is more important than knowledge you can have knowledge but if you don t have imagination you won t see life the same because when you imagine you can have more fun, see life different, and you can discover a branch of new thing you wold see life more colorful, and you can also enjoy life more how i already say you can have knowledge, and you",3.5,2.5,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.5,3.2680063247680664,3.037344455718994,3.0787816047668457,3.2850472927093506,3.080078601837158,3.0650527477264404
"not all the types of success have to be kind of hard to reach...sometime you just have to give a look in what are you good in one thing. according to the minister wistom churchill from britain about the phrase tha he said ""success consits of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiam"" is % percent true and % percent wrong. for example a person who reached the success in hard way is the now trending disigner of the brand ""off-white"" he said on a nterview that ""it wasn t easy to be in here that i m now you know?"" cause when ll this started i didn t had help so i find my own help with the company/brand nike to use some of they sneakers to make my shoes design come true, i didn t have the answer of they in one day- no! i tried and tried to get one response until one day that they say ""yes we re working together, you can use all of our sneaker desing to make your work"". now the colaboration between nike and off-white in a trending colab now in these days. this example is a hard way to reached the success but now we are going to see two cases of ""easy success"" two exampe of ""easy succes"" are the actress natalie portman and the ex-proffessional boxer mike tyson,they got their success cause they are naturally borned talented. for example the case of mike tyson, he was a years old fighting in the streets to gain some money for his family till one day a man saw him fighting with an older boy with him in which fight mike won, the man saw in tyson a potential legend in the world of the box. another caseis the case of the famous actress natalie portman, she has been a talented actress since she was a little girl. one day a friand of her mother told to natalie to make a try to win a paper in a hollywood movie in which natalie won because she was naturally born a proffessional actress, she just make her future with her talent. in conclusion not all the success people made their success with blood, sweet, and tears, some of them just were talented or used their pros to be somebody important in this world.",3.5,3.0,3.0,3.5,2.5,2.5,2.923349380493164,2.74686861038208,2.715803384780884,2.9248099327087402,2.7569351196289062,2.721341848373413
"i agree that first impression is almost impossible to change. no matter what you always want to stand out of the crowd and show the best of you. people are always going to think of you of how you first were when they met you. the first impression isn t just about you acting in a certain way. its also about you showing them your character but most important to get them thinking good things about you. i have three examples of why first impression is important. my first example is that generic_name want s his parent s to meet his girlfriend. he thinks thats her first impression of how she acts or on how she greets her self toward s them is something his parents are going to be looking at. most guys like generic_name want their girlfriend to have a good first impression so their parents like her. then second example is on the first day of school teacher s always want to give their student s a good first impression about them. either on how they teach or how smart and fun they are or anything so the students like them. last but not least my third example is when a school goes on a field trip to a museum or to another school. they want to have a good first impression on any other school that s there or anyone one because, you re representing your school. there are people who believe that first impression by a person dosen t always show how they really are. for example when you re on a date and you might be dressed in a way or talking with a different type of slang. but that dosent trully demonstrate that if the first time you guys went on a date. that on the second date you can give a better impression than you did the first date. you cant always judge someone by their appreance or on how they are. another example is that if you re best friend thinks that you want to be with the prettiest girl in school you might want to step it up and change the way you are. you can change the way you are and the first time you meet her you were rude but you re best friend thinks she will like you if your sweet and friendly. not everyone thinks the first impression is hard to change. however,i still believe that the first impression is the most important no matter what the situation is. i also still believe that the first impression is hard to change. some people are different then others they don t all believe the same thing but in my case it s hard to change how people see you the first time because,after that they are going to always look back at that and remember how you were. you always want people to think he best of you because,there going to be a situation that if they need someone they are going to look for you. to the people",3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.8550026416778564,3.611955165863037,3.7911226749420166,3.9605231285095215,3.6796860694885254,3.7264294624328613

"having activities after school are good ideas for students so they would spend the time doing good things and not thinking in make bad decisions and we do not need more bad people in this world we need more good people to succes in this world. although some people think that schools should control the students involvement in extracurricular activities nevertheless, the students should decide if the student wants to do extra activities after school because students would have the freedom to decide and some students needs that time to study or to work. first, students need to have the freedom to decide if they want to do actives after school for example some students work after school sometimes they need that time to make money to help their parents to pay bills like rent or water. if the students have activities after school they would not be able to help their parents. also some students need to take care of their family members like their brothers, sister or cousins. if the students do not help to take care of their family members their parents would have to pay somebody else and that would mean spend more money for them. the students who work are also learning more skills so in the future they would not be lazy and they are learning how an adult life is that is not to easy but they would be lucky because they would have learned that when they were younger. also sometimes parents decide for the students to do an activity that they not even like which it means that the students would not be happy and they would have a lot of stress is better that if they want to do an activities they should decide what they want to do not be a parents decision. second, students need this time after school to do homework or to study. for example if the students have activities after school they would be late at home and they would be tired which it means that they would not study or do their homework so they would get bad grades and if they try to do their schools homework they would stay up late which it means that they would not get enough of sleep so they would be sleeping and lazy at class the next day. also students need this time to take a break from the school and relax students school s life if hard sometimes they need a break from everything to came back with more energies. having enough time to study would help the students to improve their skills at school so in the future they would have more opportunities to find a good job that they would enjoy and they make money to have a decent life and support when they have a family. this shows that students should decide if they want to do extra activities after school because students can have the freedom to decide and the if the students have activities after school they would not have time to",4.0,3.5,4.0,3.5,3.5,4.0,3.5166244506835938,3.3360109329223633,3.421309471130371,3.4882185459136963,3.2908878326416016,3.467937707901001

"i agree with ralph waldo emerson s "" to be yourself in a world that os constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment."" because, in this generation kids are trying to fit in with other kids, by changing the way that they speak or the way they dress. kids also try to fit in by doing what other people tell them to do, making dumb decisions that could potentially end you up in jail or possibly something even worse effecting their future all because they wanted to fit in. peer pressure is a main factor in kids that are trying to fit in. kids pressure other kids into making poor decisions when in reality they don t wanna do it but they wanna look cool infront of others kids so they do it anyways. in reality it isn t cool to do what people tell you to do especially when it s just to fit in with others. in my opinion people shouldn t make poor decisions trying to fit in with the others, you should be yourself, it doesnt matter where you from or what type of clothes your wearing everyone should be accepted no matter who they are. kids should be leaders not followers, you can end up with the wrong friends that could care less about you, but are only with you because you make the poor decisions they re telling you to make. kids should just be themselves, you don t have to try and fit in with the others, there plenty of other kids with possibly the same interest as you.",2.5,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.5,3.0,3.715437650680542,3.618513822555542,3.606592893600464,3.8851234912872314,3.491736650466919,3.63144850730896

"working alone, students do not have to argue with other about decission of their proyects and have to work with someone they do not know; however, most students prefer to work as a group because students are able to dived work, to share ideas and to help each other. working with a group allows students to work more efficiently. personally and due to the facts, i would prefer to work with a group because working with other is more beneficial for students. firstly. most students are required to do many proyects during each marking period which is to much for each student, and specially when there is a big proyect for each class that worth % of the period s grade, but working with a group the proyect might be diveded to each person in the group, and share between them. each student have different and unique qualities that can be helpful to do do certain parts of proyects that for other can be difficult to do. secondly. working with a group might be also seen as opportunity for student of gaining values of cooperation which is important to have due to many companies assign jobs to two or more people to realize them because of the different knowledges they can provide to each other. companies usually use the phrase: ""work as a team"" to make their productivity more efficiently. teachers should see this as way of helping students to get expiriences of working as team, and also that way, we as students would get knowledge of others. by allowing students to work with group teacher might be helping student to get more confident about their due to the fact that students can disscuss betweend eache other the topics and loook forward the best way of doing them. schools are allowing students to stay after school which is perfectly fine for those students that are not able to go to a house of one the members of the group. a group might be also helpful for those students that are having issues turning their work on time because; now, they can get be supported by other and be more productive. to conclude, no students should be in the position of having a big proyect with no enough time without the opportunity of work with a groups. many companies are assigning jobs to be done by more than one person, they know that a team works more efficiently than one person, and teachers should do the same in their classes to help students to get their grades up, and also to be productive on turning work in. working with a group should be allowed for students during classes to improve their qualities of coorperation and to have different points of view to do the best for subject.",4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.5,3.0,3.442047119140625,3.2581472396850586,3.3423750400543213,3.2842674255371094,3.158618927001953,3.332684278488159
"""a problem is a chance for you to do your best"" what i think about that quote is that you cant do your best in every problem. if your still stuck on what it even means like i was in the first few minutes of seeing that, it means that in every challenge you see in life there is always a way to try your best and get through that challlenge, dispite what your mind tells you because your mind is your biggest enemy you will ever face. i dont particularly agree with that quote jsut because in certain problems even if you try your best you will still fail or if you just dont want to do the problem or other people around you dont then you most likley fail to. what im trying to get at to this quote is that instead of being ""for every problem there is a chance for you to do your best"" it should be ""for every problem or challenge there is always a way to get thorugh it"". here is a few examples: if your dying from old age and your deadline is going to be this week. then just die you get around the challlenge by dying because in most relgions there is something called heaven so you can die and go to heaven. another example: facing a hard question, just guess! you ll have a / th chance of getting it right and if you just guess it would be bettter then sitting on the problem for minutes.",2.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.5,3.0,3.080573320388794,2.888190984725952,2.956275463104248,3.0647242069244385,2.9152729511260986,2.913052797317505
"many people disagree with albert schweitzer s quote, ""example is not the main thing in influencing others; it is the only thing."" they think that he meant that it doesn t matter who did it, that the thing that matters is the example. in my case, albert schweitzer was right on his quote. although many people say that there are better ways to influence others than just with your own experience because there are famous people with more interesting examples, actually the best way to influence others is setting a good example on your own behavior because it shows that you were capable of doing it no matter how hard it was for you and yet you still did it and also you will inspire other people to do their own example based on your ideas. some people say that there are better ways to influence others because than with your own experience because there are famous people with more interesting examples. meaning that you have to be someone important in order to influence others. they say that intelligence is another way to influence others because if you re not smart you won t make a good example for others to follow. in conclusion they say that you have to be a skilled and important person to have a huge influence on others. actually, the best way to influence other is not being someone important in society but setting a good example on your own behavior. it will show that that even though it was hard for you to do your example, in the end you still did it. that show that no matter who you are or where you come from as long as you have determination you will achieve your goals. look at barack obama for example, he s a black man and yet he still managed to become president of the united states. that really had a huge impact in the black community and inspired many of them to work hard for their goals. also, you will inspire other people based on your own ideas. an article on new york times shows that most of the people based their ideas on other people s examples, which means that if you continue working hard to achieve your goals you will appear on one of those articles and will inspire others. think about it, wouldn t you like to hear that one person gave you credits because became successful because he read about your experience and he based his ideas on that experience of yours? in conclusion, many people will say that in order to influence others you need to become somebody important, but you know what? that doesn t matter! as long as you have determination and great creativity you will achieve your goals and will inspire many people to follow their dreams no matter how much it will cost them. like albert schweitzer said, ""example is not the main thing in influencing others; it is the only thing."" it doesn t matter what people say, the one that has",4.0,4.5,4.5,4.0,4.5,4.5,3.810579776763916,4.060664176940918,4.1509199142456055,4.102439880371094,3.9254226684570312,4.124199867248535
"do you think that failure is the main thing for people consist on their goal s and success without lose their enthusiasm? i agree with the important role that failure play in the pursuit of success in life because, i think failure is the main key to people reach their goal s because they need to have the idea that after failure came the success, secondly they need to be positive and have in mind what they want and how they want to reach their success in life, and last they have to be prepared for failure, and they have to be prepared to confront the failure because they need to keep in mind that not everything is going to be in the way they want, but at the same time they always need to have in mind that everything is possible with effort. first, people need to have the idea that after failure came the success, because everything happens for a reason and if something goes wrong for certain reason in the moment when they try to success they need to accept things, and keep trying. they need to be really patience for example, when babies are trying to walk they fall many times but get up and they keep trying until they reach their goal which in this case is walk or, there have been many cases when people have car accidents and they lose the ability to walk that s something that does not stop them they keep trying even if take more than a year they don t give up because their goal is to be able to walk again, their goal is to be the person they used to be before they get in that car accident, and they just want to be able to keep doing all the stuff they used to do before all the tragedy happens. secondly, everything depends in how positive people is because, if they have a negative mind and always act like their goal s is something impossible to come true their not going to accomplish nothing because people need to have the idea that they can make true everything they want, they don t have to be thinking in failure cause the more you think the more afraid you get to encourage yourself to make thing s happen and they have to try every day to improve and look for the resources available to success in life. finally, they always need to keep in mind that there always would be a chance of failure and they have the right to be afraid but, that s something they need to live aside and they need to be focus on their goal, they need to have the power to stop themselves whenever they want, and they have to be the ones to say to their self to stop when they think they already accomplish what they want but, they can t let people decide for them. because sometimes people get jealous to see the other one s success in life and they",3.5,2.5,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.5,3.4465274810791016,3.2776126861572266,3.3517134189605713,3.422869920730591,3.2564127445220947,3.3106789588928223
